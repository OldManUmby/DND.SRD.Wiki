<outline text="Races">
  <outline text="Racial Traits" _note="The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to&#10;members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of&#10;most races.">
    <outline text="Ability Score Increase" _note="Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Age" _note="The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an&#10;adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can&#10;help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You&#10;can choose any age for your character, which could provide an&#10;explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a&#10;young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low&#10;Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a&#10;high Intelligence or Wisdom.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Alignment" _note="Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this&#10;entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why&#10;your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society&#10;can help you better define your character.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Size" _note="Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures&#10;that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small&#10;(between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game&#10;affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small&#10;characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in&#10;“Equipment.”">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Speed" _note="Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling&#10;(“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Languages" _note="By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write&#10;certain languages.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Subraces" _note="Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the&#10;parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace.&#10;Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and&#10;world to world.">

<outline text="Dwarf">
  <outline text="Dwarf Traits" _note="Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and&#10;parcel of dwarven nature.&#10;&#10;***Ability Score Increase***. Your Constitution score increases by 2.&#10;&#10;***Age***. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re&#10;considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live&#10;about 350 years.&#10;&#10;***Alignment***. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the&#10;benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with&#10;a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share&#10;in the benefits of a just order.&#10;&#10;***Size***. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about&#10;150 pounds. Your size is Medium.&#10;&#10;***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not&#10;reduced by wearing heavy armor.&#10;&#10;***Darkvision***. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior&#10;vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60&#10;feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were&#10;dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.&#10;&#10;***Dwarven Resilience***. You have advantage on saving throws against&#10;poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.&#10;&#10;***Dwarven Combat Training***. You have proficiency with the battleaxe,&#10;handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.&#10;&#10;***Tool Proficiency***. You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of&#10;your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.&#10;&#10;***Stonecunning***. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check&#10;related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the&#10;History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check,&#10;instead of your normal proficiency bonus.&#10;&#10;***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish.&#10;Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those&#10;characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might&#10;speak.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Hill Dwarf" _note="As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable&#10;resilience.&#10;&#10;***Ability Score Increase***. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.&#10;&#10;***Dwarven Toughness***. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it&#10;increases by 1 every time you gain a level.">

<outline text="Elf">
  <outline text="Elf Traits" _note="Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of&#10;thousands of years of elven refinement.&#10;&#10;***Ability Score Increase***. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.&#10;&#10;***Age***. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age&#10;as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical&#10;growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims&#10;adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750&#10;years old.&#10;&#10;***Alignment***. Elves love freedom, variety, and self- expression, so&#10;they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and&#10;protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often&#10;good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile has made them&#10;vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.&#10;&#10;***Size***. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have&#10;slender builds. Your size is Medium.&#10;&#10;***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.&#10;&#10;***Darkvision***. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you&#10;have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim&#10;light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness&#10;as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only&#10;shades of gray.&#10;&#10;***Keen Senses***. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.&#10;&#10;***Fey Ancestry***. You have advantage on saving throws against being&#10;charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.&#10;&#10;***Trance***. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply,&#10;remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such&#10;meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a&#10;fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become&#10;reflexive through years of practice.&#10;&#10;After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does&#10;from 8 hours of sleep.&#10;&#10;***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish.&#10;Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven&#10;literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous&#10;among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add&#10;Elvish ballads to their repertoires.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="High Elf" _note="As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics&#10;of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high&#10;elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be&#10;superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more&#10;common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other&#10;races.&#10;&#10;***Ability Score Increase***. Your Intelligence score increases by 1.&#10;&#10;***Elf Weapon Training***. You have proficiency with the longsword,&#10;shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.&#10;&#10;***Cantrip***. You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell&#10;list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.&#10;&#10;***Extra Language***. You can speak, read, and write one extra language&#10;of your choice.">

<outline text="Halfling">
  <outline text="Halfling Traits" _note="Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other&#10;halflings.&#10;&#10;***Ability Score Increase***. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.&#10;&#10;***Age***. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally&#10;lives into the middle of his or her second century.&#10;&#10;***Alignment***. Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are&#10;good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance&#10;for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning&#10;heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old&#10;ways.&#10;&#10;***Size***. Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40&#10;pounds. Your size is Small.&#10;&#10;***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.&#10;&#10;***Lucky***. When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability&#10;check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new&#10;roll.&#10;&#10;***Brave***. You have advantage on saving throws against being&#10;frightened.&#10;&#10;***Halfling Nimbleness***. You can move through the space of any&#10;creature that is of a size larger than yours.&#10;&#10;***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The&#10;Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with&#10;others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of&#10;literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all&#10;halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they&#10;dwell or through which they are traveling.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Lightfoot" _note="As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using&#10;other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well&#10;with others.&#10;&#10;Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often&#10;dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life.&#10;&#10;***Ability Score Increase***. Your Charisma score increases by 1.&#10;&#10;***Naturally Stealthy***. You can attempt to hide even when you are&#10;obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.">
  </outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Human">
  <outline text="Human Traits" _note="It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character&#10;has these traits.&#10;&#10;***Ability Score Increase***. Your ability scores each increase by 1.&#10;&#10;***Age***. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than&#10;a century.&#10;&#10;***Alignment***. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best&#10;and the worst are found among them.&#10;&#10;***Size***. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet&#10;to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range,&#10;your size is Medium.&#10;&#10;***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.&#10;&#10;***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra&#10;language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other&#10;peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of&#10;sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc&#10;curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so&#10;on.">

<outline text="Dragonborn">
  <outline text="Dragonborn Traits" _note="Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with&#10;other dragonborn.&#10;&#10;***Ability Score Increase***. Your Strength score increases by 2, and&#10;your Charisma score increases by 1.&#10;&#10;***Age***. Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after&#10;hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child&#10;by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.&#10;&#10;***Alignment***. Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice&#10;for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil. Most&#10;dragonborn are good, but those who side with evil can be terrible&#10;villains.&#10;&#10;***Size***. Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well&#10;over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.&#10;&#10;***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.&#10;&#10;**Table- Draconic Ancestry**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;***Draconic Ancestry***. You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of&#10;dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage&#10;resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.&#10;&#10;***Breath Weapon***. You can use your action to exhale destructive&#10;energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage&#10;type of the exhalation.&#10;&#10;When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the&#10;exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by&#10;your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your&#10;Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6&#10;damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.&#10;The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at&#10;16th level.&#10;&#10;After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you&#10;complete a short or long rest.&#10;&#10;***Damage Resistance***. You have resistance to the damage type&#10;associated with your draconic ancestry.&#10;&#10;***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.&#10;Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used&#10;in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures&#10;and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.">

<outline text="Gnome">
  <outline text="Gnome Traits" _note="Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all&#10;other gnomes.&#10;&#10;***Ability Score Increase***. Your Intelligence score increases by 2.&#10;&#10;***Age***. Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are&#10;expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can&#10;live 350 to almost 500 years.&#10;&#10;***Alignment***. Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law&#10;are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or&#10;inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters,&#10;wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the&#10;tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.&#10;&#10;***Size***. Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40&#10;pounds. Your size is Small.&#10;&#10;***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.&#10;&#10;***Darkvision***. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior&#10;vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60&#10;feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were&#10;dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.&#10;&#10;***Gnome Cunning***. You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and&#10;Charisma saving throws against magic.&#10;&#10;***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The&#10;Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its&#10;technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural&#10;world.">

  <outline text="Rock Gnome" _note="As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond&#10;that of other gnomes.&#10;&#10;***Ability Score Increase***. Your Constitution score increases by 1.&#10;&#10;***Artificer’s Lore***. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History)&#10;check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological&#10;devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any&#10;proficiency bonus you normally apply.&#10;&#10;***Tinker***. You have proficiency with artisan’s tools (tinker’s&#10;tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of&#10;materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device&#10;ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it&#10;to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to&#10;dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create&#10;it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.&#10;&#10;When you create a device, choose one of the following options:&#10;&#10;***Clockwork Toy***. This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person,&#10;such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the&#10;ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in&#10;a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it&#10;represents.&#10;&#10;***Fire Starter***. The device produces a miniature flame, which you can&#10;use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires&#10;your action.&#10;&#10;***Music Box***. When opened, this music box plays a single song at a&#10;moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or&#10;when it is closed.">

Your Charisma score increases by 2, and&#10;two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.&#10;&#10;***Age***. Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach&#10;adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans,&#10;however, often exceeding 180 years.&#10;&#10;***Alignment***. Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven&#10;heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression,&#10;demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They&#10;chafe at rules, resent others’ demands, and sometimes prove unreliable,&#10;or at least unpredictable.&#10;&#10;***Size***. Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5&#10;to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.&#10;&#10;***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.&#10;&#10;***Darkvision***. Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in&#10;dark and dim conditions.

Your Strength score increases by 2, and&#10;your Constitution score increases by 1.&#10;&#10;***Age***. Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching&#10;adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live&#10;longer than 75 years.&#10;&#10;***Alignment***. Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their&#10;orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised&#10;among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually&#10;evil.&#10;&#10;***Size***. Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and&#10;they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.&#10;&#10;***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.&#10;&#10;***Darkvision***. Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in&#10;dark and dim conditions.

You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a&#10;harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its&#10;own but is written in the Dwarvish script.">

Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few&#10;years longer.&#10;&#10;***Alignment***. Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward&#10;evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature&#10;inclines many tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.&#10;&#10;***Size***. Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans.

A noble who&#10;keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would&#10;rather be honest than politic.&#10;&#10;The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual&#10;colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore&#10;with one another.

You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.&#10;&#10;Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown&#10;in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform&#10;into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t&#10;have a flying or swimming speed.&#10;&#10;**Table- Beast Shapes**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your&#10;druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless&#10;you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal&#10;form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically&#10;revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.&#10;&#10;While you are transformed, the following rules apply:&#10;&#10;-   Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast,&#10;    but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence,&#10;    Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and&#10;    saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the&#10;    creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the&#10;    bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s&#10;    bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair&#10;    actions, you can’t use them.&#10;-   When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice.&#10;    When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit&#10;    points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a&#10;    result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over&#10;    to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal&#10;    form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage.&#10;    As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0&#10;    hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.&#10;-   You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action&#10;    that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast&#10;    form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell&#10;    you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions&#10;    that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve&#10;    already cast.&#10;-   You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or&#10;    other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable&#10;    of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such&#10;    as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.&#10;-   You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space,&#10;    merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment&#10;    functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for&#10;    the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s&#10;    shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match&#10;    the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must&#10;    either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges&#10;    with the form has no effect until you leave the form.">

      <outline text="Nature’s Sanctuary" _note="When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your&#10;connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or&#10;plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving&#10;throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature&#10;must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a&#10;successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.&#10;&#10;The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against&#10;you.&#10;&#10;&gt; **Sacred Plants and Wood**&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash,&#10;&gt; birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow,&#10;&gt; and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus,&#10;&gt; incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as&#10;&gt; weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so&#10;&gt; weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it.&#10;&gt; Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make&#10;&gt; excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as&#10;&gt; well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used&#10;&gt; for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen&#10;&gt; other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a&#10;&gt; desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; **Druids and the Gods**&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids&#10;&gt; are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the&#10;&gt; multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such&#10;&gt; deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more&#10;&gt; ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.">

The vibrations are&#10;harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the&#10;target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action,&#10;the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is&#10;reduced to 0 hit points.

You know&#10;the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you&#10;sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for&#10;instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any&#10;place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the&#10;*hallow* spell.&#10;&#10;You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma&#10;modifier.

    <outline text="Preparing and Casting Spells" _note="The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your&#10;paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or&#10;higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You&#10;regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.&#10;&#10;You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to&#10;cast, choosing from the paladin spell list.

Casting the spell doesn’t remove it&#10;from your list of prepared spells.&#10;&#10;You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.&#10;Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and&#10;meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your&#10;list.">

  <outline text="Sacred Oaths" _note="Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the&#10;cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final&#10;oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all&#10;the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider&#10;themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this&#10;oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an&#10;official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.">
    <outline text="Oath of Devotion" _note="The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice,&#10;virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy&#10;warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor,&#10;acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold&#10;themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or&#10;worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear&#10;this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets&#10;as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants&#10;of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into&#10;their helmets or coats of arms.">
      <outline text="Tenets of Devotion" _note="Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary,&#10;paladins of this oath share these tenets.&#10;&#10;***Honesty***. Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.&#10;&#10;***Courage***. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.&#10;&#10;***Compassion***. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who&#10;threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.&#10;&#10;***Honor***. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be&#10;an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least&#10;amount of harm.&#10;&#10;***Duty***. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences,&#10;protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just&#10;authority over you.">

      </outline>
      <outline text="Channel Divinity" _note="When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel&#10;Divinity options.&#10;&#10;***Sacred Weapon***. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are&#10;holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute,&#10;you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon&#10;(with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a&#10;20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not&#10;already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.&#10;&#10;You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you&#10;are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall&#10;unconscious, this effect ends.&#10;&#10;***Turn the Unholy***. As an action, you present your holy symbol and&#10;speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity.&#10;Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must&#10;make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it&#10;is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.&#10;&#10;A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from&#10;you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of&#10;you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the&#10;Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from&#10;moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge&#10;action.">

      <outline text="Holy Nimbus" _note="At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1&#10;minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light&#10;shines 30 feet beyond that.&#10;&#10;Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the&#10;creature takes 10 radiant damage.&#10;&#10;In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws&#10;against spells cast by fiends or undead.&#10;&#10;Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a&#10;long rest.&#10;&#10;&gt; **Breaking Your Oath**&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even&#10;&gt; the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves&#10;&gt; too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two&#10;&gt; evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to&#10;&gt; transgress his or her oath.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a&#10;&gt; cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same&#10;&gt; order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign&#10;&gt; of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After&#10;&gt; a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of&#10;&gt; repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s&#10;&gt; discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this&#10;&gt; class and adopt another.">

    <outline text="Draconic Bloodline" _note="Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your&#10;blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin&#10;trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made&#10;a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent.&#10;Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are&#10;obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a&#10;result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.">

  <outline text="Arcane Traditions" _note="The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal&#10;discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds,&#10;with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.&#10;&#10;The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the&#10;schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of&#10;spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some&#10;places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at&#10;the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School&#10;of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like&#10;academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and&#10;funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own&#10;towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device,&#10;since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.">
    <outline text="School of Evocation" _note="You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects&#10;such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling&#10;lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military&#10;forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use&#10;their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own&#10;gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.">
      <outline text="Evocation Savant" _note="Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time&#10;you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Sculpt Spells" _note="Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within&#10;the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell&#10;that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number&#10;of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures&#10;automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they&#10;take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful&#10;save.">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Potent Cantrip" _note="Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that&#10;avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving&#10;throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage&#10;(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Empowered Evocation" _note="Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one&#10;damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Overchannel" _note="Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler&#10;spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals&#10;damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.&#10;&#10;The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this&#10;feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic&#10;damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each&#10;time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the&#10;necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores&#10;resistance and immunity.&#10;&#10;&gt; **Your Spellbook**&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect&#10;&gt; the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual&#10;&gt; breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You&#10;&gt; might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a&#10;&gt; spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or&#10;&gt; in a dusty tome in an ancient library.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; ***Copying a Spell into the Book***. When you find a wizard spell of&#10;&gt; 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a&#10;&gt; spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher&#10;&gt; and copy it.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic&#10;&gt; form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used&#10;&gt; by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you&#10;&gt; understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into&#10;&gt; your spellbook using your own notation.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50&#10;&gt; gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you&#10;&gt; experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you&#10;&gt; need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can&#10;&gt; prepare the spell just like your other spells.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; ***Replacing the Book***. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook&#10;&gt; into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of&#10;&gt; your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your&#10;&gt; spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own&#10;&gt; notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1&#10;&gt; hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; \*If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to&#10;&gt; transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.&#10;&gt; Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new&#10;&gt; spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup&#10;&gt; spellbooks in a safe place.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; ***The Book’s Appearance***. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of&#10;&gt; spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might&#10;&gt; be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from&#10;&gt; your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient&#10;&gt; library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after&#10;&gt; you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.">

<outline text="Multiclassing" _note="Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so&#10;lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character&#10;concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class&#10;options.&#10;&#10;With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class&#10;whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your&#10;current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to&#10;determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in&#10;wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.&#10;&#10;As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your&#10;original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might&#10;change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind.&#10;You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to&#10;a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus&#10;in exchange for versatility.">
  <outline text="Prerequisites" _note="To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score&#10;prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in&#10;the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who&#10;decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and&#10;Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a&#10;beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new&#10;class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-&#10;than-average ability scores.&#10;&#10;**Table- Multiclassing Prerequisites**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

  <outline text="Experience Points" _note="The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total&#10;character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your&#10;level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you&#10;must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second&#10;level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.">

If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply&#10;pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a&#10;d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If&#10;your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them&#10;separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five&#10;d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.">

<outline text="Class Features" _note="When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that&#10;level.

  <outline text="Channel Divinity" _note="If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a&#10;class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity&#10;effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t&#10;give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you&#10;reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if&#10;you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between&#10;rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more&#10;uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel&#10;Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Extra Attack" _note="If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the&#10;features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with&#10;this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra&#10;Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting&#10;Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Unarmored Defense" _note="If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it&#10;again from another class.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Spellcasting" _note="Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in&#10;all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in&#10;those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one&#10;class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting&#10;feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that&#10;class.&#10;&#10;***Spells Known and Prepared***. You determine what spells you know and&#10;can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed&#10;member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you&#10;know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger&#10;class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your&#10;spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained&#10;when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your&#10;Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your&#10;spellbook.&#10;&#10;Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes,&#10;and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the&#10;spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be&#10;used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.&#10;&#10;If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase&#10;is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class&#10;&#10;***Spell Slots***. You determine your available spell slots by adding&#10;together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and&#10;wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and&#10;ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by&#10;consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.&#10;&#10;If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you&#10;spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can&#10;prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level&#10;spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like *burning hands*, has&#10;an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the&#10;enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher&#10;level.&#10;&#10;For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count&#10;as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have&#10;four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots.&#10;However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any&#10;2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to&#10;cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.&#10;&#10;***Pact Magic***. If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and&#10;the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the&#10;spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know&#10;or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and&#10;you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature&#10;to cast warlock spells you know.&#10;&#10;**Table- Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

<outline text="Feats" _note="A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a&#10;character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and&#10;abilities beyond what a class provides.&#10;&#10;At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement&#10;feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that&#10;feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat&#10;only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.&#10;&#10;You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If&#10;you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you&#10;regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to&#10;have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13&#10;somehow-perhaps by a withering curse-you can’t benefit from the Grappler&#10;feat until your Strength is restored.">

<outline text="Alignment" _note="A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly&#10;describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination&#10;of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and&#10;the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic,&#10;or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible&#10;combinations.&#10;&#10;These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical&#10;behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary&#10;significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly&#10;and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.&#10;&#10;**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing&#10;as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are&#10;lawful good.&#10;&#10;**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according&#10;to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are&#10;neutral good.&#10;&#10;**Chaotic good** (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with&#10;little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and&#10;unicorns are chaotic good.&#10;&#10;**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law,&#10;tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful&#10;neutral.&#10;&#10;**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of&#10;moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time.&#10;Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.&#10;&#10;**Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their&#10;personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some&#10;bards, are chaotic neutral.&#10;&#10;**Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within&#10;the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue&#10;dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.&#10;&#10;**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can&#10;get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud&#10;giants, and goblins are neutral evil.&#10;&#10;**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by&#10;their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are&#10;chaotic evil.">
  <outline text="Alignment in the Multiverse" _note="For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans,&#10;dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow&#10;the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-&#10;aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their&#10;moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.&#10;&#10;The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to&#10;serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the&#10;nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the&#10;orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a&#10;good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its&#10;entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s&#10;influence.)&#10;&#10;Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A&#10;devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward&#10;lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow&#10;ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.&#10;&#10;Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have&#10;alignments-they are **unaligned**. Such a creature is incapable of&#10;making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial&#10;nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil;&#10;they have no alignment.">

Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled&#10;soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue&#10;might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a&#10;jester.&#10;&#10;Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your&#10;character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your&#10;background is *what changed*? Why did you stop doing whatever your&#10;background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money&#10;to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy&#10;background, why don’t you have *more* money? How did you learn the&#10;skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share&#10;your background?&#10;&#10;The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits&#10;(features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.">
  <outline text="Proficiencies" _note="Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described&#10;in “Using Ability Scores”).&#10;&#10;In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or&#10;more tools (detailed in “Equipment”).&#10;&#10;If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different&#10;sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind&#10;(skill or tool) instead.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Languages" _note="Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages&#10;beyond those given by race. See “Languages.”">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Equipment" _note="Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the&#10;optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting&#10;equipment from your background.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Suggested Characteristics" _note="A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your&#10;background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them&#10;randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of&#10;your own creation.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Customizing a Background" _note="You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it&#10;better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a&#10;background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any&#10;two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages&#10;from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package&#10;from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment&#10;section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package&#10;suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one&#10;ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches&#10;your desired background, work with your GM to create one.">

  <outline text="Acolyte" _note="You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or&#10;pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the&#10;holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering&#10;sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the&#10;divine. You are not necessarily a cleric - performing sacred rites is&#10;not the same thing as channeling divine power.&#10;&#10;Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from&#10;among those listed in “Fantasy-Historical Pantheons” or those specified&#10;by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious&#10;service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from&#10;childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high&#10;priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different&#10;way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any&#10;established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a&#10;fiendish master that you now deny.&#10;&#10;**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion&#10;&#10;**Languages:** Two of your choice&#10;&#10;**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the&#10;priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense,&#10;vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp">
    <outline text="Feature: Shelter of the Faithful" _note="As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith,&#10;and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your&#10;adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a&#10;temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you&#10;must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share&#10;your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.&#10;&#10;You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen&#10;deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the&#10;temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or&#10;a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you&#10;can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you&#10;ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your&#10;temple.">

    <outline text="Suggested Characteristics" _note="Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious&#10;communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and&#10;their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their&#10;mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or&#10;heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.&#10;&#10;**Table- Suggested Acolyte Characteristics**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

  <outline text="Coinage" _note="Common coins come in several different denominations based on the&#10;relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most&#10;common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the&#10;copper piece (cp).&#10;&#10;With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good&#10;rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one&#10;gold piece a day. The old piece is the standard unit of measure for&#10;wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants&#10;discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands&#10;of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of&#10;individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value,&#10;and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable&#10;goods.&#10;&#10;One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among&#10;commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer’s work for half a day, a flask&#10;of lamp oil, or a night’s rest in a poor inn.&#10;&#10;One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among&#10;laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a&#10;piece of chalk.&#10;&#10;In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes&#10;appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum&#10;piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they&#10;sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An&#10;electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is&#10;worth ten gold pieces.&#10;&#10;A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a&#10;pound.&#10;&#10;**Table- Standard Exchange Rates**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

  <outline text="Selling Treasure" _note="Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and&#10;more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures&#10;and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided&#10;that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.&#10;&#10;***Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment***. As a general rule, undamaged&#10;weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a&#10;market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough&#10;condition to sell.&#10;&#10;***Magic Items***. Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone&#10;to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of&#10;the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few&#10;common magic items, you won’t normally come across magic items or spells&#10;to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should&#10;always be treated as such.&#10;&#10;***Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects***. These items retain their full&#10;value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or&#10;use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable&#10;treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or&#10;larger community first.&#10;&#10;***Trade Goods***. On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions&#10;through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods-bars of iron,&#10;bags of salt, livestock, and so on-retain their full value in the market&#10;and can be used as currency.">

<outline text="Armor" _note="Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different&#10;cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason,&#10;adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from&#10;leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other&#10;kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly&#10;available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three&#10;categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors&#10;supplement their armor with a shield.&#10;&#10;The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the&#10;common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.&#10;&#10;***Armor Proficiency***. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a&#10;shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to&#10;wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with&#10;certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency&#10;with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or&#10;attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast&#10;spells.&#10;&#10;***Armor Class (AC)***. Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The&#10;armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.&#10;&#10;***Heavy Armor***. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to&#10;move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13”&#10;or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces&#10;the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score&#10;equal to or higher than the listed score.&#10;&#10;***Stealth***. If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth&#10;column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.&#10;&#10;***Shields***. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one&#10;hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit&#10;from only one shield at a time.">
  <outline text="Light Armor" _note="Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile&#10;adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing&#10;mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to&#10;the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.&#10;&#10;***Padded***. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and&#10;batting.&#10;&#10;***Leather***. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are&#10;made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest&#10;of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.&#10;&#10;***Studded Leather***. Made from tough but flexible leather, studded&#10;leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Medium Armor" _note="Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also&#10;impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity&#10;modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to&#10;determine your Armor Class.&#10;&#10;***Hide***. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is&#10;commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who&#10;lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.&#10;&#10;***Chain Shirt***. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is&#10;worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest&#10;protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings&#10;rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.&#10;&#10;***Scale Mail***. This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and&#10;perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of&#10;metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.&#10;&#10;***Breastplate***. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece&#10;worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms&#10;relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the&#10;wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.&#10;&#10;***Half Plate***. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover&#10;most of the wearer’s body. It does not include leg protection beyond&#10;simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Heavy Armor" _note="Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection.&#10;These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a&#10;wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight&#10;and bulk.&#10;&#10;Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor&#10;Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is&#10;negative.&#10;&#10;***Ring Mail***. This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into&#10;it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and&#10;axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it’s usually worn only by&#10;those who can’t afford better armor.&#10;&#10;***Chain Mail***. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes&#10;a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing&#10;and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.&#10;&#10;***Splint***. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal&#10;riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding.&#10;Flexible chain mail protects the joints.&#10;&#10;***Plate***. Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to&#10;cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather&#10;boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the&#10;armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.&#10;&#10;**Table- Armor**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Getting Into and Out of Armor" _note="The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category.&#10;&#10;***Don***. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from&#10;the armor’s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.&#10;&#10;***Doff***. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have&#10;help, reduce this time by half.&#10;&#10;**Table- Donning and Doffing Armor**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

<outline text="Weapons" _note="Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the&#10;class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you&#10;favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it&#10;effectively can mean the difference between life and death while&#10;adventuring.&#10;&#10;The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy&#10;gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they&#10;hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified&#10;as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target&#10;within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a&#10;target at a distance.">
  <outline text="Weapon Proficiency" _note="Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain&#10;weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are **simple** and&#10;**martial**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These&#10;weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands&#10;of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms,&#10;require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use&#10;martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and&#10;training to best use.&#10;&#10;Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to&#10;the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an&#10;attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not&#10;add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Weapon Properties" _note="Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in&#10;the Weapons table.&#10;&#10;***Ammunition***. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property&#10;to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the&#10;weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of&#10;ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other&#10;container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a&#10;one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your&#10;expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.&#10;&#10;If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee&#10;attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised&#10;Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any&#10;damage when used in this way.&#10;&#10;***Finesse***. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your&#10;choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage&#10;rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.&#10;&#10;***Heavy***. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with&#10;heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a&#10;Small creature to use effectively.&#10;&#10;***Light***. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal&#10;for use when fighting with two weapons.&#10;&#10;***Loading***. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can&#10;fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus&#10;action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you&#10;can normally make.&#10;&#10;***Range***. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a&#10;range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range&#10;lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and&#10;the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target&#10;beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t&#10;attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.&#10;&#10;***Reach***. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with&#10;it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with&#10;it (see chapter \#\#).&#10;&#10;***Special***. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules&#10;governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special&#10;Weapons” later in this section).&#10;&#10;***Thrown***. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the&#10;weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use&#10;the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you&#10;would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw&#10;a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use&#10;either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse&#10;property.&#10;&#10;***Two-Handed***. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with&#10;it.&#10;&#10;***Versatile***. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage&#10;value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the&#10;weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.">
    <outline text="Improvised Weapons" _note="Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with&#10;whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can&#10;wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying&#10;pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.&#10;&#10;Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be&#10;treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s&#10;option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as&#10;if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.&#10;&#10;An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM&#10;assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a&#10;ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does&#10;not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised&#10;thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.">
      <outline text="Silvered Weapons" _note="Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are&#10;susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin&#10;to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or&#10;ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the&#10;price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to&#10;the weapon without making it less effective.">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Special Weapons" _note="Weapons with special rules are described here.&#10;&#10;***Lance***. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a&#10;target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield&#10;when you aren’t mounted.&#10;&#10;***Net***. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until&#10;it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or&#10;creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make&#10;a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its&#10;reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also&#10;frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying&#10;the net.&#10;&#10;When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net,&#10;you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can&#10;normally make.&#10;&#10;**Table- Weapons**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

<outline text="Adventuring Gear" _note="This section describes items that have special rules or require further&#10;explanation.&#10;&#10;***Acid***. As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto&#10;a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet,&#10;shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a&#10;creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit,&#10;the target takes 2d6 acid damage.&#10;&#10;***Alchemist’s Fire***. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed&#10;to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering&#10;it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object,&#10;treating the alchemist’s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the&#10;target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A&#10;creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10&#10;Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.&#10;&#10;***Antitoxin***. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains&#10;advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no&#10;benefit to undead or constructs.&#10;&#10;***Arcane Focus***. An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal,&#10;a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or&#10;some similar item- designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A&#10;sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting&#10;focus.&#10;&#10;***Ball Bearings***. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls&#10;from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a&#10;side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10&#10;Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area&#10;at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.&#10;&#10;***Block and Tackle***. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through&#10;them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to&#10;hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.&#10;&#10;***Book***. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts,&#10;information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes&#10;on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be&#10;represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook&#10;(described later in this section).&#10;&#10;***Caltrops***. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover&#10;a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the&#10;area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this&#10;turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the&#10;creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least&#10;1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t&#10;need to make the save.&#10;&#10;***Candle***. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius&#10;and dim light for an additional 5 feet.&#10;&#10;***Case, Crossbow Bolt***. This wooden case can hold up to twenty&#10;crossbow bolts.&#10;&#10;***Case, Map or Scroll***. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to&#10;ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.&#10;&#10;***Chain***. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a&#10;successful DC 20 Strength check.&#10;&#10;***Climber’s Kit***. A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips,&#10;gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to&#10;anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the&#10;point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet&#10;away from that point without undoing the anchor.&#10;&#10;***Component Pouch***. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather&#10;belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and&#10;other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those&#10;components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell’s&#10;description).&#10;&#10;***Crowbar***. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where&#10;the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.&#10;&#10;***Druidic Focus***. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or&#10;holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff&#10;drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating&#10;feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use&#10;such an object as a spellcasting focus.&#10;&#10;***Fishing Tackle***. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line,&#10;corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow&#10;netting. Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages,&#10;salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend&#10;one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points,&#10;without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.&#10;&#10;***Holy Symbol***. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or&#10;pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity,&#10;the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield,&#10;or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B&#10;“Fantasy-Historical Pantheons” lists the symbols commonly associated&#10;with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy&#10;symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the&#10;caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.&#10;&#10;***Holy Water***. As an action, you can splash the contents of this&#10;flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet,&#10;shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a&#10;target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the&#10;target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or&#10;paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual&#10;takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and&#10;requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.&#10;&#10;***Hunting Trap***. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms&#10;a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a&#10;pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an&#10;immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A&#10;creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity&#10;saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter,&#10;until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by&#10;the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its&#10;action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another&#10;creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1&#10;piercing damage to the trapped creature.&#10;&#10;***Lamp***. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light&#10;for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1&#10;pint) of oil. Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light&#10;in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it&#10;burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Hooded. A hooded&#10;lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an&#10;additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint)&#10;of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim&#10;light in a 5-foot radius.&#10;&#10;***Lock***. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature&#10;proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC&#10;15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available&#10;for higher prices.&#10;&#10;***Magnifying Glass***. This lens allows a closer look at small objects.&#10;It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting&#10;fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright&#10;as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire&#10;to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made&#10;to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.&#10;&#10;***Manacles***. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium&#10;creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity&#10;check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each&#10;set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature&#10;proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a&#10;successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.&#10;&#10;***Mess Kit***. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box&#10;clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other&#10;as a plate or shallow bowl.&#10;&#10;***Oil***. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an&#10;action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5&#10;feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a&#10;ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as&#10;an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the&#10;target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the&#10;target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can&#10;also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot square area,&#10;provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds&#10;and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its&#10;turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.&#10;&#10;***Poison, Basic***. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one&#10;slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition.&#10;Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned&#10;weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take&#10;1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute&#10;before drying.&#10;&#10;***Potion of Healing***. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in&#10;this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion&#10;takes an action.&#10;&#10;***Pouch***. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or&#10;50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for&#10;holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier&#10;in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. Ram,&#10;Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so,&#10;you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help&#10;you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.&#10;&#10;***Rations***. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended&#10;travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.&#10;&#10;***Rope***. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can&#10;be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.&#10;&#10;***Scale, Merchant’s***. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a&#10;suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure&#10;the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade&#10;goods, to help determine their worth.&#10;&#10;***Spellbook***. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound&#10;tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.&#10;&#10;***Spyglass***. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice&#10;their size.&#10;&#10;***Tent***. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.&#10;&#10;***Tinderbox***. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and&#10;tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire.&#10;Using it to light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed&#10;fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.&#10;&#10;***Torch***. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a&#10;20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a&#10;melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.&#10;&#10;**Equipment Packs**&#10;&#10;The starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of&#10;useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these&#10;packs are listed here. If you are buying your starting equipment, you&#10;can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than&#10;buying the items individually.&#10;&#10;***Burglar’s Pack (16 gp)***. Includes a backpack, a bag of 1,000 ball&#10;bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a hammer, 10&#10;pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days rations, a tinderbox,&#10;and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to&#10;the side of it.&#10;&#10;***Diplomat’s Pack (39 gp)***. Includes a chest, 2 cases for maps and&#10;scrolls, a set of fine clothes, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a lamp, 2&#10;flasks of oil, 5 sheets of paper, a vial of perfume, sealing wax, and&#10;soap.&#10;&#10;***Dungeoneer’s Pack (12 gp)***. Includes a backpack, a crowbar, a&#10;hammer, 10 pitons, 10 torches, a tinderbox, 10 days of rations, and a&#10;waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side&#10;of it.&#10;&#10;***Entertainer’s Pack (40 gp)***. Includes a backpack, a bedroll, 2&#10;costumes, 5 candles, 5 days of rations, a waterskin, and a disguise kit.&#10;&#10;***Explorer’s Pack (10 gp)***. Includes a backpack, a bedroll, a mess&#10;kit, a tinderbox, 10 torches, 10 days of rations, and a waterskin. The&#10;pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.&#10;&#10;***Priest’s Pack (19 gp)***. Includes a backpack, a blanket, 10 candles,&#10;a tinderbox, an alms box, 2 blocks of incense, a censer, vestments, 2&#10;days of rations, and a waterskin.&#10;&#10;***Scholar’s Pack (40 gp)***. Includes a backpack, a book of lore, a&#10;bottle of ink, an ink pen, 10 sheets of parchment, a little bag of sand,&#10;and a small knife.&#10;&#10;**Table- Adventuring Gear**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;**Table- Container Capacity**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;\* You can also strap items, such as a bedroll or a coil of rope, to the&#10;outside of a backpack.">

<outline text="Tools" _note="A tool helps you to do something you couldn’t otherwise do, such as&#10;craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race,&#10;class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools.&#10;Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any&#10;ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single&#10;ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of&#10;its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to&#10;carve a fine detail with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to&#10;make something out of particularly hard wood.&#10;&#10;**Table- Tools**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;\* See the “Mounts and Vehicles” section.&#10;&#10;***Artisan’s Tools***. These special tools include the items needed to&#10;pursue a craft or trade. The table shows examples of the most common&#10;types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft.&#10;Proficiency with a set of artisan’s tools lets you add your proficiency&#10;bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each&#10;type of artisan’s tools requires a separate proficiency.&#10;&#10;***Disguise Kit***. This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props&#10;lets you create disguises that change your physical appearance.&#10;Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any&#10;ability checks you make to create a visual disguise.&#10;&#10;***Forgery Kit***. This small box contains a variety of papers and&#10;parchments, pens and inks, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf,&#10;and other supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical&#10;documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus&#10;to any ability checks you make to create a physical forgery of a&#10;document.&#10;&#10;***Gaming Set***. This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces,&#10;including dice and decks of cards (for games such as Three-Dragon Ante).&#10;A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of&#10;gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add&#10;your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with&#10;that set. Each type of gaming set requires a separate proficiency.&#10;&#10;***Herbalism Kit***. This kit contains a variety of instruments such as&#10;clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to&#10;create remedies and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your&#10;proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply&#10;herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin&#10;and potions of healing.&#10;&#10;***Musical Instrument***. Several of the most common types of musical&#10;instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency&#10;with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to&#10;any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard&#10;can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of&#10;musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.&#10;&#10;***Navigator’s Tools***. This set of instruments is used for navigation&#10;at sea. Proficiency with navigator’s tools lets you chart a ship’s&#10;course and follow navigation charts. In addition, these tools allow you&#10;to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid&#10;getting lost at sea.&#10;&#10;***Poisoner’s Kit***. A poisoner’s kit includes the vials, chemicals,&#10;and other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency&#10;with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks&#10;you make to craft or use poisons.&#10;&#10;***Thieves’ Tools***. This set of tools includes a small file, a set of&#10;lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of&#10;narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these&#10;tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make&#10;to disarm traps or open locks.">

<outline text="Mounts and Vehicles" _note="A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but&#10;its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you&#10;down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal’s speed and&#10;base carrying capacity.&#10;&#10;An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move&#10;weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight&#10;of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add&#10;their carrying capacity together.&#10;&#10;Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming&#10;worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These&#10;include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar&#10;animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example).&#10;Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the&#10;creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or&#10;negotiating with the mount itself.&#10;&#10;***Barding***. Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s head,&#10;neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be&#10;purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made&#10;for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.&#10;&#10;***Saddles***. A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your&#10;seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check&#10;you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any&#10;aquatic or flying mount.&#10;&#10;***Vehicle Proficiency***. If you have proficiency with a certain kind&#10;of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any&#10;check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult&#10;circumstances.&#10;&#10;***Rowed Vessels***. Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and&#10;rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3&#10;miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be&#10;rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream&#10;by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case&#10;adventurers carry it over land.&#10;&#10;**Table- Mounts and Other Animals**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;**Table- Tack, Harness, and Drawn Vehicles**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;**Table- Waterborne Vehicles**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

<outline text="Trade Goods" _note="Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain, land,&#10;rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a&#10;forest).&#10;&#10;Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are&#10;granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant&#10;ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set&#10;prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who&#10;may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly&#10;exchange trade goods without using currency. The Trade Goods table shows&#10;the value of commonly exchanged goods.&#10;&#10;**Table- Cost of Trade Goods**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

<outline text="Expenses" _note="When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for&#10;lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness,&#10;adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world,&#10;people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and&#10;clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more&#10;than others.">
  <outline text="Lifestyle Expenses" _note="Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost&#10;of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and&#10;drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the&#10;cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure&#10;next calls.&#10;&#10;At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle&#10;from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The&#10;prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your&#10;chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by&#10;30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on&#10;the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same&#10;lifestyle throughout your character’s career.&#10;&#10;Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy&#10;lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful,&#10;though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally&#10;might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful&#10;connections.&#10;&#10;**Table- Lifestyle Expenses**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;***Wretched***. You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call&#10;home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old&#10;crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A&#10;wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and&#10;hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your&#10;armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their&#10;standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.&#10;&#10;***Squalid***. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just&#10;outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of&#10;town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate&#10;and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and&#10;misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few&#10;legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered&#10;some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or&#10;suffer from disease.&#10;&#10;***Poor***. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available&#10;in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing,&#10;and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably&#10;unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a&#10;flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some&#10;legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime,&#10;and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled&#10;laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other&#10;disreputable types.&#10;&#10;***Modest***. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures&#10;that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town,&#10;renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry&#10;or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary&#10;people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families,&#10;laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.&#10;&#10;***Comfortable***. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can&#10;afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live&#10;in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room&#10;at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and&#10;military officers.&#10;&#10;***Wealthy***. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of&#10;luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated&#10;with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle&#10;comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of&#10;the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have&#10;respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or&#10;a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of&#10;servants.&#10;&#10;***Aristocratic***. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in&#10;circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have&#10;excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or&#10;rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the&#10;most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your&#10;every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich&#10;and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild&#10;leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the&#10;highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the&#10;greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn&#10;or participant.">

  <outline text="Food, Drink, and Lodging" _note="The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food&#10;items and a single night’s lodging. These prices are included in your&#10;total lifestyle expenses.&#10;&#10;**Table- Food, Drink, and Lodging**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;&gt; **Self-Sufficiency**&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are&#10;&gt; spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of&#10;&gt; whatever services you can afford-paying for food and shelter, paying&#10;&gt; townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on.&#10;&gt; Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from&#10;&gt; civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging,&#10;&gt; and repairing their own gear.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any&#10;&gt; coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between&#10;&gt; adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of&#10;&gt; a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at&#10;&gt; the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.">

  <outline text="Services" _note="Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their&#10;behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly&#10;ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few&#10;are experts with specialized adventuring skills.&#10;&#10;Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table.&#10;Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who&#10;inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform&#10;a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to&#10;construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the&#10;*secret chest* spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a&#10;special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for&#10;an upcoming performance in front of the duke.&#10;&#10;Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary&#10;soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are&#10;hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a&#10;high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she&#10;might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a&#10;castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These&#10;hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live&#10;within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.&#10;&#10;Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that&#10;involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary,&#10;artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert&#10;hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial&#10;work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers,&#10;porters, maids, and similar workers.&#10;&#10;**Table- Services**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Spellcasting Services" _note="People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of&#10;ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast&#10;a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no&#10;established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the&#10;desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the&#10;more it costs.&#10;&#10;Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level,&#10;such as *cure wounds* or *identify*, is easy enough in a city or town,&#10;and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive&#10;material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a&#10;higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one&#10;with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might&#10;ask for a service instead of payment-the kind of service that only&#10;adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous&#10;locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something&#10;important to a distant settlement.">

<outline text="Abilities" _note="Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical&#10;and mental characteristics:&#10;&#10;-   **Strength**, measuring physical power&#10;-   **Dexterity**, measuring agility&#10;-   **Constitution**, measuring endurance&#10;-   **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory&#10;-   **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight&#10;-   **Charisma**, measuring force of personality&#10;&#10;Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming?&#10;Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature’s&#10;assets as well as weaknesses.&#10;&#10;The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw,&#10;and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book’s&#10;introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20,&#10;add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and&#10;compare the total to a target number.">
  <outline text="Ability Scores and Modifiers" _note="Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the&#10;magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of&#10;innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and&#10;competence in activities related to that ability.&#10;&#10;A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and&#10;many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18&#10;is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have&#10;scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as&#10;high as 30.&#10;&#10;Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging&#10;from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The&#10;Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the&#10;range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.&#10;&#10;**Table- Ability Scores and Modifiers**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract&#10;10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).&#10;&#10;Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability&#10;check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often&#10;than their associated scores.">
  </outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Advantage and Disadvantage" _note="Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage&#10;or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll.&#10;When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the&#10;higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if&#10;you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a&#10;17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those&#10;numbers, you use the 17.&#10;&#10;If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or&#10;imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20.&#10;If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll&#10;only one additional d20.&#10;&#10;If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage,&#10;you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This&#10;is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one&#10;grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither&#10;advantage nor disadvantage.&#10;&#10;When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such&#10;as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you&#10;can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose which one. For&#10;example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check&#10;and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll&#10;the 1.&#10;&#10;You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special&#10;abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character&#10;advantage. The&#10;&#10;GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction&#10;or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.">

<outline text="Proficiency Bonus" _note="Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also&#10;have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus&#10;is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.&#10;&#10;Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other&#10;number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can&#10;add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless&#10;add the bonus only once when you make the save.&#10;&#10;Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided&#10;(doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the&#10;rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain&#10;ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus&#10;applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and&#10;multiply or divide it only once.&#10;&#10;By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your&#10;proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally&#10;benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to&#10;the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact&#10;that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack&#10;proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature&#10;that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence&#10;(History) checks.&#10;&#10;In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls&#10;or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same&#10;rules apply.">
</outline>
<outline text="Ability Checks" _note="An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and&#10;training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an&#10;ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than&#10;an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain,&#10;the dice determine the results.&#10;&#10;For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is&#10;relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented&#10;by a Difficulty Class.&#10;&#10;The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty&#10;Classes table shows the most common DCs.&#10;&#10;**Table- Difficulty Classes**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability&#10;modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and&#10;compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the&#10;ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the challenge at hand.&#10;Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no&#10;progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback&#10;determined by the GM.">
  <outline text="Contests" _note="Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to&#10;another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same&#10;thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic&#10;ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one&#10;of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal-&#10;for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an&#10;adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is&#10;determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.&#10;&#10;Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their&#10;efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead&#10;of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two&#10;checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest.&#10;That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the&#10;other one from succeeding.&#10;&#10;If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it&#10;was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by&#10;default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the&#10;floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying&#10;to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie&#10;means that the door remains shut.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Skills" _note="Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that&#10;a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a&#10;specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in&#10;a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting&#10;skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a&#10;monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)&#10;&#10;For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to&#10;pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each&#10;of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics,&#10;Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has&#10;proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity&#10;checks related to sneaking and hiding.&#10;&#10;The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following&#10;list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s&#10;description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to&#10;use a skill associated with an ability.&#10;&#10;**Table- Related Skills**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific&#10;skill-for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a&#10;player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to&#10;a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can&#10;add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that&#10;skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal&#10;ability check.&#10;&#10;For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the&#10;GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is&#10;proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to&#10;the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she&#10;just makes a Strength check.">
    <outline text="Variant: Skills with Different Abilities" _note="Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of&#10;ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to&#10;Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might&#10;reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM&#10;might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill,&#10;or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different&#10;check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the&#10;mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have&#10;the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you&#10;to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution&#10;(Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your&#10;proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally&#10;do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc&#10;barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM&#10;might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation&#10;is normally associated with Charisma.">

  </outline>
  <outline text="Passive Checks" _note="A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve&#10;any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task&#10;done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again,&#10;or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the&#10;characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a&#10;hidden monster.&#10;&#10;Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:&#10;&#10;10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check&#10;&#10;If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage,&#10;subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.&#10;&#10;For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency&#10;in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.&#10;&#10;The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive&#10;checks, as do the exploration rules.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Working Together" _note="Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The&#10;character who’s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability&#10;modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help&#10;provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help&#10;action.&#10;&#10;A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she&#10;could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires&#10;proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that&#10;proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a&#10;character can help only when two or more individuals working together&#10;would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle,&#10;are no easier with help.">
    <outline text="Group Checks" _note="When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a&#10;group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation,&#10;the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who&#10;aren’t.&#10;&#10;To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability&#10;check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.&#10;Otherwise, the group fails.&#10;&#10;Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all&#10;the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers&#10;are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival)&#10;check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and&#10;other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group&#10;succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions&#10;out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.">

Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult&#10;situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples&#10;include the following activities:&#10;&#10;-   You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while&#10;    scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to&#10;    knock you off.&#10;-   You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt&#10;    midjump.&#10;-   You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents,&#10;    storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed.

This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry,&#10;which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry&#10;about it.&#10;&#10;***Push, Drag, or Lift***. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in&#10;pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength&#10;score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying&#10;capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.&#10;&#10;***Size and Strength***. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas&#10;Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium,&#10;double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push,&#10;drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.">

The Acrobatics,&#10;Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of&#10;Dexterity checks.&#10;&#10;***Acrobatics***. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt&#10;to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying&#10;to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on&#10;a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity&#10;(Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including&#10;dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.&#10;&#10;***Sleight of Hand***. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or&#10;manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or&#10;concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)&#10;check.

Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in&#10;combat.&#10;&#10;&gt; **Hiding**&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you&#10;&gt; try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are&#10;&gt; discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the&#10;&gt; Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for&#10;&gt; signs of your presence.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give&#10;&gt; away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or&#10;&gt; knocking over a vase.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage&#10;&gt; might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around,&#10;&gt; so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees&#10;&gt; you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to&#10;&gt; stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing&#10;&gt; you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; ***Passive Perception***. When you hide, there’s a chance someone will&#10;&gt; notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a&#10;&gt; creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check&#10;&gt; with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals&#10;&gt; 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or&#10;&gt; penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage,&#10;&gt; subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency&#10;&gt; bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in&#10;&gt; Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; ***What Can You See?*** One of the main factors in determining whether&#10;&gt; you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an&#10;&gt; area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained&#10;&gt; in the “Adventuring” section.">

When you attempt to influence someone or a group of&#10;people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to&#10;make a Charisma (Persuasion) check.

Examples of persuading others include&#10;convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating&#10;peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.&#10;&#10;***Other Charisma Checks***. The GM might call for a Charisma check when&#10;you try to accomplish tasks like the following:&#10;&#10;-   Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip&#10;-   Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Spellcasting Ability" _note="Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their&#10;spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of&#10;spells they cast.">

<outline text="Saving Throws" _note="A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a&#10;spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t&#10;normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one&#10;because your character or monster is at risk of harm.&#10;&#10;To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability&#10;modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity&#10;saving throw.&#10;&#10;A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can&#10;be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.&#10;&#10;Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard,&#10;for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill&#10;proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or&#10;her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability&#10;score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.&#10;&#10;The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that&#10;causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is&#10;determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.&#10;&#10;The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in&#10;the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a&#10;creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.">

<outline text="Adventuring">
</outline>
<outline text="Time" _note="In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important,&#10;the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different&#10;time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a&#10;dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of&#10;**minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway,&#10;another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall,&#10;and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything&#10;interesting or valuable.&#10;&#10;In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate.&#10;Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest&#10;hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.&#10;&#10;For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best.&#10;&#10;Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers&#10;spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their&#10;journey.&#10;&#10;In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on&#10;**rounds**, a 6-second span of time.">
</outline>
<outline text="Movement" _note="Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor,&#10;scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a key&#10;role in fantasy gaming adventures.&#10;&#10;The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact&#10;distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the&#10;dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a&#10;dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can&#10;summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at&#10;the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map,&#10;which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by&#10;a narrow stone arch.”&#10;&#10;Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from&#10;one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes.&#10;The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed&#10;and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving&#10;over.">
  <outline text="Speed" _note="Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet&#10;that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes&#10;short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening&#10;situation.&#10;&#10;The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in&#10;a minute, an hour, or a day.">
    <outline text="Travel Pace" _note="While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or&#10;slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far&#10;the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any&#10;effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace&#10;makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.&#10;&#10;***Forced March***. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel&#10;for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of&#10;exhaustion.&#10;&#10;For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover&#10;the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character&#10;must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is&#10;10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character&#10;suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix \#\#).&#10;&#10;***Mounts and Vehicles***. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many&#10;animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at&#10;a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast&#10;pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can&#10;cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in&#10;densely populated areas.&#10;&#10;Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as&#10;normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of&#10;the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain&#10;benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the&#10;crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.&#10;&#10;Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special&#10;vehicles, such as a *carpet of flying*, allow you to travel more&#10;swiftly.&#10;&#10;**Table- Travel Pace**&#10;&#10;**Distance Traveled Per …**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Difficult Terrain" _note="The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively&#10;simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But&#10;adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins,&#10;steep mountains, and ice-covered ground-all considered difficult&#10;terrain.&#10;&#10;You move at half speed in difficult terrain- moving 1 foot in difficult&#10;terrain costs 2 feet of speed-so you can cover only half the normal&#10;distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Special Types of Movement" _note="Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves&#10;more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim,&#10;or jump to get where they need to go.">
    <outline text="Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling" _note="While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2&#10;extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or&#10;swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface&#10;or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics)&#10;check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a&#10;successful Strength (Athletics) check.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Jumping" _note="Your Strength determines how far you can jump.&#10;&#10;***Long Jump***. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet&#10;up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot&#10;immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can&#10;leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the&#10;jump costs a foot of movement.&#10;&#10;This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a&#10;jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on&#10;a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller&#10;than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall.&#10;Otherwise, you hit it.&#10;&#10;When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10&#10;Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land&#10;prone.&#10;&#10;***High Jump***. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a&#10;number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least&#10;10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing&#10;high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot&#10;you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances,&#10;your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump&#10;higher than you normally can.&#10;&#10;You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the&#10;jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of&#10;the jump plus 1½ times your height.">

</outline>
<outline text="The Environment" _note="By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark,&#10;dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this&#10;section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers&#10;interact with the environment in such places.">
  <outline text="Falling" _note="A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an&#10;adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning&#10;damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature&#10;lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Suffocating" _note="A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its&#10;Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).&#10;&#10;When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a&#10;number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1&#10;round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is&#10;dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can&#10;breathe again.&#10;&#10;For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath&#10;for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air&#10;before it drops to 0 hit points.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Vision and Light" _note="The most fundamental tasks of adventuring- noticing danger, finding&#10;hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to&#10;name just a few-rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness&#10;and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.&#10;&#10;A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly&#10;obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage,&#10;creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on&#10;sight.&#10;&#10;A **heavily obscured** area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense&#10;foliage-blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the&#10;blinded condition (see appendix \#\#) when trying to see something in&#10;that area.&#10;&#10;The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three&#10;categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.&#10;&#10;**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally.&#10;&#10;Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires,&#10;and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.&#10;&#10;**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An&#10;area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright&#10;light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of&#10;twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant&#10;full moon might bathe the land in dim light.&#10;&#10;**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area.&#10;&#10;Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights),&#10;within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in&#10;an area of magical darkness.">
    <outline text="Blindsight" _note="A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying&#10;on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as&#10;oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as&#10;bats and true dragons, have this sense.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Darkvision" _note="Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell&#10;underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with&#10;darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so&#10;areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is&#10;concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only&#10;shades of gray.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Truesight" _note="A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal&#10;and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically&#10;detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and&#10;perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is&#10;transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the&#10;Ethereal Plane.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Food and Water" _note="Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see&#10;appendix \#\#). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be&#10;removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.">
    <outline text="Food" _note="A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last&#10;longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a&#10;day counts as half a day without food.&#10;&#10;A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or&#10;her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond&#10;that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.&#10;&#10;A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Water" _note="A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if&#10;the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water&#10;must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of&#10;exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less&#10;water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the&#10;day.&#10;&#10;If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the&#10;character takes two levels in either case.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Interacting with Objects" _note="A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple&#10;to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her&#10;character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM&#10;describes what, if anything, happens.&#10;&#10;For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in&#10;turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a&#10;secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position,&#10;though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM&#10;might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench&#10;the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the&#10;difficulty of the task.&#10;&#10;Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells.&#10;Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can&#10;be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The&#10;GM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide&#10;that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of&#10;attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects&#10;always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to&#10;effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points,&#10;it breaks.&#10;&#10;A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM&#10;sets the DC for any such check.">
  </outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Resting" _note="Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the&#10;day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They&#10;need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds&#10;and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further&#10;adventure.&#10;&#10;Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and&#10;a long rest to end the day.">
  <outline text="Short Rest" _note="A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which&#10;a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading,&#10;and tending to wounds.&#10;&#10;A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest,&#10;up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the&#10;character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls&#10;the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The&#10;character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The&#10;player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A&#10;character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as&#10;explained below.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Long Rest" _note="A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long,&#10;during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no&#10;more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating,&#10;or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous&#10;activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or&#10;similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to&#10;gain any benefit from it.&#10;&#10;At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The&#10;character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to&#10;half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For&#10;example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four&#10;spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.&#10;&#10;A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour&#10;period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of&#10;the rest to gain its benefits.">
  </outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Between Adventures" _note="Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers&#10;need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure.&#10;Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as&#10;crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their&#10;hard-earned gold.&#10;&#10;In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little&#10;fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might&#10;simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to&#10;describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other&#10;times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing&#10;as events beyond your perception stay in motion.">
  <outline text="Lifestyle Expenses" _note="Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the&#10;cost of maintaining that lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your&#10;character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and&#10;groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic&#10;lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the&#10;city than if you live in poverty.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Downtime Activities" _note="Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing&#10;during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration,&#10;but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete&#10;before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be&#10;spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not&#10;need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days&#10;to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time,&#10;or switch to a new downtime activity.&#10;&#10;Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If&#10;you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an&#10;activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.">
    <outline text="Crafting" _note="You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and&#10;works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object&#10;you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also&#10;need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it.&#10;For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in&#10;order to craft a sword or suit of armor.&#10;&#10;For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more&#10;items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend&#10;raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want&#10;to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every&#10;day in 5 gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For&#10;example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to&#10;craft by yourself.&#10;&#10;Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a&#10;single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the&#10;requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each&#10;character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping&#10;to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool&#10;proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in&#10;100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.&#10;&#10;While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to&#10;pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Practicing a Profession" _note="You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest&#10;lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long&#10;you continue to practice your profession.&#10;&#10;If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful&#10;employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to&#10;support a comfortable lifestyle instead.&#10;&#10;If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your&#10;performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to&#10;support a wealthy lifestyle instead.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Recuperating" _note="You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating&#10;injury, disease, or poison.&#10;&#10;After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15&#10;Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of&#10;the following results:&#10;&#10;-   End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.&#10;-   For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one&#10;    disease or poison currently affecting you.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Researching" _note="The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research,&#10;gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the&#10;campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling&#10;scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and&#10;gossip from their lips.&#10;&#10;When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information&#10;is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and&#10;whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to&#10;seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also&#10;require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence&#10;(Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you&#10;seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone’s aid. Once&#10;those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.&#10;&#10;For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses.&#10;This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Training" _note="You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or&#10;training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training&#10;options.&#10;&#10;First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM&#10;determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are&#10;required.&#10;&#10;The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend&#10;the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or&#10;gain proficiency with the new tool.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Combat" _note="A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of&#10;weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game&#10;organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A&#10;**round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round,&#10;each participant in a battle takes a **turn**. The order of turns is&#10;determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls&#10;initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the&#10;next round if neither side has defeated the other.&#10;&#10;&gt; Combat Step by Step&#10;&gt; ===================&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; 1.  **Determine surprise.** The GM determines whether anyone involved&#10;&gt;     in the combat encounter is surprised.&#10;&gt; 2.  **Establish positions.** The GM decides where all the characters&#10;&gt;     and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or&#10;&gt;     their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM&#10;&gt;     figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what&#10;&gt;     direction.&#10;&gt; 3.  **Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter&#10;&gt;     rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.&#10;&gt; 4.  **Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in&#10;&gt;     initiative order.&#10;&gt; 5.  **Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has&#10;&gt;     had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting&#10;&gt;     stops.">
  <outline text="Surprise" _note="A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the&#10;trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage,&#10;unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In&#10;these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.&#10;&#10;The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be&#10;stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM&#10;compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the&#10;passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side.&#10;Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at&#10;the start of the encounter.&#10;&#10;If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn&#10;of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A&#10;member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Initiative" _note="Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat&#10;starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their&#10;place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group&#10;of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same&#10;time.&#10;&#10;The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest&#10;Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order&#10;(called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The&#10;initiative order remains the same from round to round.&#10;&#10;If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled&#10;creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters.&#10;The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player&#10;character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters&#10;each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Your Turn" _note="On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take&#10;one action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action&#10;first. Your speed- sometimes called your walking speed-is noted on your&#10;character sheet.&#10;&#10;The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in&#10;Combat” section later in this chapter. Many class features and other&#10;abilities provide additional options for your action.&#10;&#10;The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter gives the&#10;rules for your move.&#10;&#10;You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your&#10;turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the&#10;Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Bonus Actions" _note="Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an&#10;additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action&#10;feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can&#10;take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature&#10;of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You&#10;otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.&#10;&#10;You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose&#10;which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.&#10;&#10;You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the&#10;bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of&#10;your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus&#10;action.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Other Activity on Your Turn" _note="Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your&#10;action nor your move.&#10;&#10;You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and&#10;gestures, as you take your turn.&#10;&#10;You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for&#10;free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could&#10;open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could&#10;draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.&#10;&#10;If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your&#10;action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an&#10;action to use, as stated in their descriptions.&#10;&#10;The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities&#10;when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For&#10;instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a&#10;stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.">
  </outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Reactions" _note="Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a&#10;special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a&#10;trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s.&#10;The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most&#10;common type of reaction.&#10;&#10;When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of&#10;your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that&#10;creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.">
</outline>
<outline text="Movement and Position" _note="In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using&#10;movement and position to gain the upper hand.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as&#10;much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the&#10;rules here.&#10;&#10;Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These&#10;different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can&#10;constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the&#10;distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up&#10;or until you are done moving.">
  <outline text="Breaking Up Your Move" _note="You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed&#10;before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30&#10;feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.">
    <outline text="Moving between Attacks" _note="If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can&#10;break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For&#10;example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack&#10;feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an&#10;attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Using Different Speeds" _note="If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying&#10;speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your&#10;move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved&#10;from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move.&#10;If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the&#10;current move.&#10;&#10;For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because&#10;a wizard cast the *fly* spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk&#10;10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Difficult Terrain" _note="Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.&#10;Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases-the&#10;setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.&#10;&#10;Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This&#10;rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult&#10;terrain.&#10;&#10;Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs&#10;are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature,&#10;whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Being Prone" _note="Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because&#10;they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the&#10;game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.&#10;&#10;You can **drop prone** without using any of your speed. **Standing up**&#10;takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half&#10;your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend&#10;&#10;15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have&#10;enough movement left or if your speed is 0.&#10;&#10;To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use magic such as&#10;teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot.&#10;Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of&#10;movement.&#10;&#10;&gt; **Interacting with Objects Around You**&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem&#10;&gt; with your movement and action:&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; -   draw or sheathe a sword&#10;&gt; -   open or close a door&#10;&gt; -   withdraw a potion from your backpack&#10;&gt; -   pick up a dropped axe&#10;&gt; -   take a bauble from a table&#10;&gt; -   remove a ring from your finger&#10;&gt; -   stuff some food into your mouth&#10;&gt; -   plant a banner in the ground&#10;&gt; -   fish a few coins from your belt pouch&#10;&gt; -   drink all the ale in a flagon&#10;&gt; -   throw a lever or a switch&#10;&gt; -   pull a torch from a sconce&#10;&gt; -   take a book from a shelf you can reach&#10;&gt; -   extinguish a small flame&#10;&gt; -   don a mask&#10;&gt; -   pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head&#10;&gt; -   put your ear to a door&#10;&gt; -   kick a small stone&#10;&gt; -   turn a key in a lock&#10;&gt; -   tap the floor with a 10-foot pole&#10;&gt; -   hand an item to another character">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Moving Around Other Creatures" _note="You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can&#10;move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least&#10;two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s&#10;space is difficult terrain for you.&#10;&#10;Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your&#10;move in its space.&#10;&#10;If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an&#10;opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Flying Movement" _note="Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also&#10;deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone,&#10;has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to&#10;move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is&#10;being held aloft by magic, such as by the *fly* spell.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Creature Size" _note="Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories&#10;table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in&#10;combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.&#10;&#10;**Table- Creature Size**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">
    <outline text="Space" _note="A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in&#10;combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium&#10;creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space&#10;that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot wide doorway, other&#10;creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.&#10;&#10;A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively.&#10;For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can&#10;surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight&#10;creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.&#10;&#10;Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround&#10;a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller&#10;one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty&#10;Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.">
      <outline text="Squeezing into a Smaller Space" _note="A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a&#10;creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze&#10;through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a&#10;space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there,&#10;and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.&#10;Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the&#10;smaller space.">

</outline>
<outline text="Actions in Combat" _note="When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions&#10;presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special&#10;feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action&#10;options of their own in their stat blocks.&#10;&#10;When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM&#10;tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need&#10;to make, if any, to determine success or failure.">
  <outline text="Attack" _note="The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether&#10;you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with&#10;your fists.&#10;&#10;With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “Making&#10;an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.&#10;&#10;Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow&#10;you to make more than one attack with this action.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Cast a Spell" _note="Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have&#10;access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell&#10;has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an&#10;action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a&#10;spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a&#10;casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action&#10;in combat to cast such a spell.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Dash" _note="When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current&#10;turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With&#10;a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn&#10;if you dash.&#10;&#10;Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement&#10;by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for&#10;instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Disengage" _note="If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke&#10;opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Dodge" _note="When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks.&#10;Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has&#10;disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving&#10;throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated&#10;(as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Help" _note="You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task.&#10;When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on&#10;the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping&#10;with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next&#10;turn.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature&#10;within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other&#10;way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally&#10;attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made&#10;with advantage.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Hide" _note="When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in&#10;an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you&#10;gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and&#10;Targets” section later in this chapter.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Ready" _note="Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular&#10;circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on&#10;your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of&#10;your next turn.&#10;&#10;First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your&#10;reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that&#10;trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it.&#10;Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the&#10;lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”&#10;&#10;When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after&#10;the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take&#10;only one reaction per round.&#10;&#10;When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which&#10;you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a&#10;spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s&#10;magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell&#10;dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating&#10;on the *web* spell and ready *magic missile*, your *web* spell ends, and&#10;if you take damage before you release *magic missile* with your&#10;reaction, your concentration might be broken.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Search" _note="When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding&#10;something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you&#10;make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation)&#10;check.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Use an Object" _note="You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as&#10;when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your&#10;action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is&#10;also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your&#10;turn.">
  </outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Making an Attack" _note="Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range,&#10;or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple&#10;structure.&#10;&#10;-   **Choose a target**. Pick a target within your attack’s **Range:** a&#10;    creature, an object, or a location.&#10;-   **Determine modifiers**. The GM determines whether the target has&#10;    cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the&#10;    target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects&#10;    can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.&#10;-   **Resolve the attack**. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll&#10;    damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify&#10;    otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or&#10;    instead of damage.&#10;&#10;If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an&#10;attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re&#10;making an attack.">
  <outline text="Attack Rolls" _note="When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack&#10;hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the&#10;appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or&#10;exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a&#10;character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a&#10;monster is in its stat block.">
    <outline text="Modifiers to the Roll" _note="When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to&#10;the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus.&#10;When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is&#10;provided in its stat block.&#10;&#10;***Ability Modifier.*** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon&#10;attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon&#10;attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property&#10;break this rule.&#10;&#10;Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a&#10;spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.&#10;&#10;***Proficiency Bonus.*** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack&#10;roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as&#10;well as when you attack with a spell.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Rolling 1 or 20" _note="Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit&#10;and the veteran to miss.&#10;&#10;If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any&#10;modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit, which is&#10;explained later in this chapter.&#10;&#10;If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of&#10;any modifiers or the target’s AC.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Unseen Attackers and Targets" _note="Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the&#10;invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.&#10;&#10;When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on&#10;the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s&#10;location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the&#10;target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but&#10;the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you&#10;guessed the target’s location correctly.&#10;&#10;When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls&#10;against it. If you are hidden-both unseen and unheard-when you make an&#10;attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Ranged Attacks" _note="When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a&#10;handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A&#10;monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve&#10;making a ranged attack.">
    <outline text="Range" _note="You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified&#10;range.&#10;&#10;If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range,&#10;you can’t attack a target beyond this range.&#10;&#10;Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow,&#10;have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger&#10;number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your&#10;target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the&#10;long range.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Ranged Attacks in Close Combat" _note="Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When&#10;you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means,&#10;you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a&#10;hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Melee Attacks" _note="Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe&#10;within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such&#10;as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee&#10;attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other&#10;body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.&#10;&#10;Most creatures have a 5-foot **reach** and can thus attack targets&#10;within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures&#10;(typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater&#10;reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.&#10;&#10;Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an&#10;**unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow&#10;(none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals&#10;bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are&#10;proficient with your unarmed strikes.&#10;&#10;&gt; ***Contests in Combat***&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe.&#10;&gt; Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes&#10;&gt; the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling&#10;&gt; and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for&#10;&gt; improvising others.">
    <outline text="Opportunity Attacks" _note="In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an&#10;enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an&#10;opportunity attack.&#10;&#10;You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can&#10;see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use&#10;your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature.&#10;The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.&#10;&#10;You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage&#10;action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport&#10;or when someone or something moves you without using your movement,&#10;action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity&#10;attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity&#10;causes you to fall past an enemy.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Two-Weapon Fighting" _note="When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon&#10;that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack&#10;with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other&#10;hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus&#10;attack, unless that modifier is negative.&#10;&#10;If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon,&#10;instead of making a melee attack with it.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Grappling" _note="When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the&#10;Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able&#10;to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces&#10;one of them.&#10;&#10;The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you&#10;and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to&#10;seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a&#10;Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength&#10;(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the&#10;ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is&#10;incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled&#10;condition (see appendix \#\#). The condition specifies the things that&#10;end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action&#10;required).&#10;&#10;***Escaping a Grapple***. A grappled creature can use its action to&#10;escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity&#10;(Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.&#10;&#10;***Moving a Grappled Creature***. When you move, you can drag or carry&#10;the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the&#10;creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Shoving a Creature" _note="Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a&#10;creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re&#10;able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack&#10;replaces one of them.&#10;&#10;The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be&#10;within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength&#10;(Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or&#10;Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).&#10;You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you&#10;succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from&#10;you.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Cover" _note="Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during&#10;combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit&#10;from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the&#10;opposite side of the cover.&#10;&#10;There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources&#10;of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees&#10;aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature&#10;that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover,&#10;the target has three-quarters cover.&#10;&#10;A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving&#10;throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of&#10;its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture,&#10;a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or&#10;a friend.&#10;&#10;A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and&#10;Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about&#10;three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a&#10;portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.&#10;&#10;A target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or&#10;a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in&#10;an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely&#10;concealed by an obstacle.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Damage and Healing" _note="Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who&#10;explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed&#10;arrow, or a blast of flame from a *fireball* spell all have the&#10;potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.">
    <outline text="Hit Points" _note="Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability,&#10;the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more&#10;difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.&#10;&#10;A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be&#10;any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number&#10;changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.&#10;&#10;Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit&#10;points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s&#10;capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Damage Rolls" _note="Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it&#10;deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the&#10;damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other&#10;factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to&#10;deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.&#10;&#10;When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier-the same&#10;modifier used for the attack roll-to the damage. A **spell** tells you&#10;which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.&#10;&#10;If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at&#10;the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a&#10;wizard casts *fireball* or a cleric casts *flame strike*, the spell’s&#10;damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Critical Hits" _note="When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the&#10;attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice&#10;twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal.&#10;To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.&#10;&#10;For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the&#10;damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If&#10;the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak&#10;Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Damage Types" _note="Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal&#10;different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but&#10;other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.&#10;&#10;The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type&#10;to a new effect.&#10;&#10;***Acid***. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the&#10;dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.&#10;&#10;***Bludgeoning***. Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction,&#10;and the like-deal bludgeoning damage.&#10;&#10;***Cold***. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and&#10;the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.&#10;&#10;***Fire***. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to&#10;deal fire damage.&#10;&#10;***Force***. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form.&#10;Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including *magic&#10;missile* and *spiritual weapon*.&#10;&#10;***Lightning***. A *lightning bolt* spell and a blue dragon’s breath&#10;deal lightning damage.&#10;&#10;***Necrotic***. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell&#10;such as *chill touch*, withers matter and even the soul.&#10;&#10;***Piercing***. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and&#10;monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.&#10;&#10;***Poison***. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s&#10;breath deal poison damage.&#10;&#10;***Psychic***. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast&#10;deal psychic damage.&#10;&#10;***Radiant***. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s *flame strike* spell&#10;or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads&#10;the spirit with power.&#10;&#10;***Slashing***. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.&#10;&#10;***Thunder***. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the&#10;*thunderwave* spell, deals thunder damage.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Damage Resistance and Vulnerability" _note="Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy&#10;to hurt with certain types of damage.&#10;&#10;If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage&#10;of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has&#10;**vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled&#10;against it.&#10;&#10;Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers&#10;to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage&#10;and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature&#10;is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25&#10;damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10&#10;damage.&#10;&#10;Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same&#10;damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has&#10;resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical&#10;damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the&#10;creature, not reduced by three-quarters.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Healing" _note="Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is&#10;reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit&#10;points, and magical methods such as a *cure wounds* spell or a *potion&#10;of healing* can remove damage in an instant.&#10;&#10;When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are&#10;added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed&#10;its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this&#10;number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of&#10;healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point&#10;maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.&#10;&#10;A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the&#10;*revivify* spell has restored it to life.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Dropping to 0 Hit Points" _note="When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall&#10;unconscious, as explained in the following sections.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Instant Death" _note="Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit&#10;points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage&#10;equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.&#10;&#10;For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6&#10;hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0&#10;hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals&#10;her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Falling Unconscious" _note="If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall&#10;unconscious (see appendix \#\#). This unconsciousness ends if you regain&#10;any hit points.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Death Saving Throws" _note="Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special&#10;saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you&#10;creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws,&#10;this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate&#10;now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of&#10;succeeding on a saving throw.&#10;&#10;Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you&#10;fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third&#10;success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die.&#10;The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of&#10;both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to&#10;zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.&#10;&#10;***Rolling 1 or 20***. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1&#10;on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you&#10;regain 1 hit point.&#10;&#10;***Damage at 0 Hit Points***. If you take any damage while you have 0&#10;hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is&#10;from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage&#10;equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.">
      <outline text="Stabilizing a Creature" _note="The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If&#10;healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that&#10;it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.&#10;&#10;You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious&#10;creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10&#10;Wisdom (Medicine) check.&#10;&#10;A **stable** creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it&#10;has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops&#10;being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it&#10;takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit&#10;point after 1d4 hours.">
      </outline>
    </outline>
    <outline text="Monsters and Death" _note="Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather&#10;than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.&#10;&#10;Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions;&#10;the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as&#10;player characters.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Knocking a Creature Out" _note="Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a&#10;killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a&#10;melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can&#10;make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls&#10;unconscious and is stable.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Temporary Hit Points" _note="Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a&#10;creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a&#10;buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from&#10;injury.&#10;&#10;When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit&#10;points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your&#10;normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and&#10;take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.&#10;&#10;Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points,&#10;they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be&#10;at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.&#10;&#10;Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added&#10;together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you&#10;decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For&#10;example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already&#10;have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.&#10;&#10;If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore&#10;you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage&#10;directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can&#10;save you.&#10;&#10;Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration,&#10;they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.">

<outline text="Mounted Combat" _note="A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells&#10;from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a&#10;pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can&#10;provide.&#10;&#10;A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that&#10;has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following&#10;rules.">
  <outline text="Mounting and Dismounting" _note="Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of&#10;you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your&#10;speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of&#10;movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t&#10;have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.&#10;&#10;If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you&#10;must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount,&#10;landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone&#10;while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.&#10;&#10;If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it&#10;as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and&#10;fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Controlling a Mount" _note="While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the&#10;mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as&#10;dragons, act independently.&#10;&#10;You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider.&#10;Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have&#10;such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match&#10;yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only&#10;three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can&#10;move and act even on the turn that you mount it.&#10;&#10;An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing&#10;a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it&#10;moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack&#10;and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.&#10;&#10;In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re&#10;on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.">

Underwater the&#10;following rules apply.&#10;&#10;When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that doesn’t have a&#10;swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on&#10;the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword,&#10;spear, or trident.&#10;&#10;A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a target beyond the&#10;weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the&#10;attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or&#10;a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or&#10;dart).&#10;&#10;Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance&#10;to fire damage.">

<outline text="Spellcasting" _note="Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a&#10;spell.&#10;&#10;This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Different character&#10;classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells,&#10;and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a&#10;spell follows the rules here.">
</outline>
<outline text="What Is a Spell?" _note="A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical&#10;energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited&#10;expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the&#10;invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place&#10;in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then&#10;releases them to unleash the desired effect-in most cases, all in the&#10;span of seconds.&#10;&#10;Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can&#10;deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix \#\#),&#10;drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.&#10;&#10;Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the&#10;multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might&#10;yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or&#10;trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented&#10;by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.">
  <outline text="Spell Level" _note="Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general&#10;indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive)&#10;*magic missile* at 1st level and the earth-shaking *wish* at 9th.&#10;Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by&#10;rote-are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a&#10;spellcaster must be to use that spell.&#10;&#10;Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a&#10;character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a&#10;9th-level spell.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Known and Prepared Spells" _note="Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell&#10;firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item.&#10;Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited&#10;list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing&#10;is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as&#10;clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process&#10;varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.&#10;&#10;In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at&#10;any given time depends on the character’s level.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Spell Slots" _note="Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can&#10;cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the&#10;fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is&#10;physically and mentally taxing, and higher level spells are even more&#10;so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the&#10;warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell&#10;level a character can use at each character level. For example, the&#10;3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level&#10;slots.&#10;&#10;When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s&#10;level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can&#10;think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a&#10;1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell&#10;fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a&#10;9th-level slot. So when Umara casts *magic missile*, a 1st-level spell,&#10;she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.&#10;&#10;Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.&#10;&#10;Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast&#10;spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the&#10;Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch&#10;invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in&#10;such a way.">
    <outline text="Casting a Spell at a Higher Level" _note="When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level&#10;than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For&#10;instance, if Umara casts *magic missile* using one of her 2nd-level&#10;slots, that *magic missile* is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands&#10;to fill the slot it is put into.&#10;&#10;Some spells, such as *magic missile* and *cure wounds*, have more&#10;powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s&#10;description.&#10;&#10;&gt; **Casting in Armor**&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for&#10;&gt; spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to&#10;&gt; cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered&#10;&gt; by your armor for spellcasting.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Cantrips" _note="A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell&#10;slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed&#10;the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic&#10;needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is&#10;0.">
</outline>
<outline text="Rituals" _note="Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast&#10;following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as&#10;a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast&#10;than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual&#10;version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.&#10;&#10;To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that&#10;grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have&#10;such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his&#10;or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature&#10;specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.&#10;&#10;&gt; ***The Schools of Magic***&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools&#10;&gt; of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to&#10;&gt; all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same&#10;&gt; way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their&#10;&gt; own, although some rules refer to the schools.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; **Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them&#10;&gt; have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful&#10;&gt; effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of&#10;&gt; existence.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; **Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and&#10;&gt; creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures&#10;&gt; or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to&#10;&gt; teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or&#10;&gt; effects out of nothing.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; **Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of&#10;&gt; secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of&#10;&gt; hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant&#10;&gt; people or places.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; **Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or&#10;&gt; controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the&#10;&gt; caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or&#10;&gt; even control another creature like a puppet.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; **Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired&#10;&gt; effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel&#10;&gt; positive energy to heal wounds.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; **Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause&#10;&gt; people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are&#10;&gt; there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never&#10;&gt; happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can&#10;&gt; see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the&#10;&gt; mind of a creature.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; **Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such&#10;&gt; spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy&#10;&gt; from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back&#10;&gt; to life.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as&#10;&gt; animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells&#10;&gt; frequently.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; **Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object,&#10;&gt; or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature,&#10;&gt; bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s&#10;&gt; command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly&#10;&gt; recover from injury.">
</outline>
<outline text="Casting a Spell" _note="When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed,&#10;regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.&#10;&#10;Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the&#10;spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components,&#10;and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.">
  <outline text="Casting Time" _note="Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a&#10;bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.">
    <outline text="Bonus Action" _note="A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a&#10;bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t&#10;already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell&#10;during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1&#10;action.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Reactions" _note="Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a&#10;second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell&#10;can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when&#10;you can do so.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Longer Casting Times" _note="Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to&#10;cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time&#10;longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each&#10;turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while&#10;you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken,&#10;the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try&#10;casting the spell again, you must start over.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Spell Range" _note="The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like&#10;*magic missile*, the target is a creature. For a spell like *fireball*,&#10;the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.&#10;&#10;Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a&#10;creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the&#10;*shield* spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.&#10;&#10;Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also&#10;have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s&#10;effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect” later in the this chapter).&#10;&#10;Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless&#10;the spell’s description says otherwise.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Components" _note="A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in&#10;order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires&#10;verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t&#10;provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the&#10;spell.">
    <outline text="Verbal (V)" _note="Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves&#10;aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular&#10;combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the&#10;threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an&#10;area of silence, such as one created by the *silence* spell, can’t cast&#10;a spell with a verbal component.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Somatic (S)" _note="Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an&#10;intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the&#10;caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these&#10;gestures.">

    <outline text="Material (M)" _note="Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in&#10;parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component&#10;pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in “Equipment”) in place of&#10;the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a&#10;component, a character must have that specific component before he or&#10;she can cast the spell.&#10;&#10;If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell,&#10;the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.&#10;&#10;A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material&#10;components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can be the same hand&#10;that he or she uses to perform somatic components.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Duration" _note="A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration&#10;can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells&#10;specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or&#10;destroyed.">
    <outline text="Instantaneous" _note="Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or&#10;alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because&#10;its magic exists only for an instant.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Concentration" _note="Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their&#10;magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.&#10;&#10;If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in&#10;its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate&#10;on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).&#10;&#10;Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with&#10;concentration. The following factors can break concentration:&#10;&#10;-   **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose&#10;    concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires&#10;    concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.&#10;-   **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are&#10;    concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw&#10;    to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage&#10;    you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from&#10;    multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a&#10;    separate saving throw for each source of damage.&#10;-   **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell&#10;    if you are incapacitated or if you die.&#10;&#10;The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a&#10;wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you&#10;to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain&#10;concentration on a spell.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Targets" _note="A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected&#10;by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell&#10;targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect&#10;(described below).&#10;&#10;Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it&#10;was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is&#10;obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a&#10;creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says&#10;otherwise.">
    <outline text="A Clear Path to the Target" _note="To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be&#10;behind total cover.&#10;&#10;If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an&#10;obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of&#10;origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Targeting Yourself" _note="If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself,&#10;unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other&#10;than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can&#10;target yourself.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Areas of Effect" _note="Spells such as *burning hands* and *cone of cold* cover an area,&#10;allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.&#10;&#10;A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has&#10;one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.&#10;Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which&#10;the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you&#10;position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in&#10;space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an&#10;object.&#10;&#10;A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If&#10;no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a&#10;location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the&#10;spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must&#10;provide total cover.">
    <outline text="Cone" _note="A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A&#10;cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s&#10;distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its&#10;maximum length.&#10;&#10;A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect,&#10;unless you decide otherwise.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Cube" _note="You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of&#10;the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each&#10;side.&#10;&#10;A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect,&#10;unless you decide otherwise.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Cylinder" _note="A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular&#10;radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on&#10;the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a&#10;cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the&#10;perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s&#10;effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance&#10;equal to the height of the cylinder.&#10;&#10;A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of&#10;effect.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Line" _note="A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its&#10;length and covers an area defined by its width.&#10;&#10;A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect,&#10;unless you decide otherwise.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Sphere" _note="You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward&#10;from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that&#10;extends from the point.&#10;&#10;A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Spell Saving Throws" _note="Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some&#10;or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the&#10;target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.&#10;&#10;The DC to resist one of your spells = 8 + your spellcasting ability&#10;modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.">
</outline>
<outline text="Spell Attack Rolls" _note="Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine&#10;whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus&#10;with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your&#10;proficiency bonus.&#10;&#10;Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember&#10;that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5&#10;feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t&#10;incapacitated.">
</outline>
<outline text="Combining Magical Effects" _note="The effects of different spells add together while the durations of&#10;those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times&#10;don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect-such as the&#10;highest bonus-from those castings applies while their durations overlap.&#10;&#10;For example, if two clerics cast *bless* on the same target, that&#10;character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to&#10;roll two bonus dice.">

Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a&#10;hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at&#10;the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with&#10;acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of&#10;its next turn.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***.

Choose one creature you can see within range,&#10;or choose two creatures you can see within range that are within 5 feet&#10;of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take&#10;1d6 acid damage.&#10;&#10;This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6),&#10;11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).">

Choose a door, a window, or&#10;an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the&#10;spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature&#10;touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can&#10;designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose&#10;whether the alarm is mental or audible.&#10;&#10;A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1&#10;mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.&#10;&#10;An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within&#10;60 feet.">

When you cast the spell, choose one of the&#10;following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the&#10;spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to&#10;gain the benefits of a different one.&#10;&#10;***Aquatic Adaptation***. You adapt your body to an aquatic environment,&#10;sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can&#10;breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking&#10;speed.&#10;&#10;***Change Appearance***. You transform your appearance. You decide what&#10;you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of&#10;your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics,&#10;if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though&#10;none of your statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a&#10;different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re&#10;bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance.&#10;At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to&#10;change your appearance in this way again.&#10;&#10;***Natural Weapons***. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a&#10;different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6&#10;bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural&#10;weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes.&#10;Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the&#10;attack and damage rolls you make using it.">

Choose a&#10;beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the&#10;beast’s Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the&#10;beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the&#10;spell’s duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the&#10;spells ends.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a  spell slot of&#10;2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast t level above&#10;1st.">

  <outline text="Animal Messenger" _note="*2nd-level enchantment (ritual)*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 action&#10;&#10;**Range:** 30 feet&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** 24 hours&#10;&#10;By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a&#10;Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or&#10;a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a&#10;recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman&#10;dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing&#10;a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The&#10;target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified&#10;location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger,&#10;or 25 miles for other animals.&#10;&#10;When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature&#10;that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger&#10;speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the&#10;messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the&#10;message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this&#10;spell.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd&#10;level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for&#10;each slot level above 2nd.">

Choose any number of willing&#10;creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into&#10;the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or&#10;lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform&#10;affected creatures into new forms.&#10;&#10;The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the&#10;target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form&#10;for each target. A target’s game statistics are replaced by the&#10;statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment&#10;and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the&#10;hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it&#10;returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it&#10;reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage&#10;carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t&#10;reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked&#10;unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by&#10;the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.&#10;&#10;The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t activate,&#10;wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.">

  <outline text="Animate Dead" _note="*3rd-level necromancy*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 minute&#10;&#10;**Range:** 10 feet&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch&#10;of bone dust)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Instantaneous&#10;&#10;This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse&#10;of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target&#10;with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The&#10;target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a&#10;corpse (the GM has the creature’s game statistics).&#10;&#10;On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command&#10;any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet&#10;of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of&#10;them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide&#10;what action the creature will take and where it will move during its&#10;next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a&#10;particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature&#10;only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the&#10;creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.&#10;&#10;The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops&#10;obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature&#10;for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again&#10;before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts&#10;your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this&#10;spell, rather than animating a new one.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of&#10;4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional&#10;undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures&#10;must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.">

  <outline text="Animate Objects" _note="*5th-level transmutation*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 action&#10;&#10;**Range:** 120 feet&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute&#10;&#10;Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical&#10;objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets&#10;count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets&#10;count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object larger than Huge.&#10;Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the&#10;spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.&#10;&#10;As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with&#10;this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control&#10;multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time,&#10;issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the&#10;creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you&#10;can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or&#10;corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself&#10;against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues&#10;to follow it until its task is complete.&#10;&#10;**Table- Animate Object Stats**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks,&#10;Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10&#10;and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed&#10;is&#10;&#10;30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for&#10;locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If&#10;the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as&#10;a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a&#10;radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated&#10;object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form,&#10;and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.&#10;&#10;If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack&#10;against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an&#10;attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might&#10;rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based&#10;on its form.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th&#10;level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot&#10;level above 5th.">

The barrier lasts for the duration.&#10;&#10;The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching&#10;through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with&#10;ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.&#10;&#10;If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the&#10;barrier, the spell ends.">

  <outline text="Antimagic Field" _note="*8th-level abjuration*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 action&#10;&#10;**Range:** Self (10-foot radius sphere)&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour&#10;&#10;A 10-foot radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area&#10;is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within&#10;the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even&#10;magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with&#10;you, centered on you.&#10;&#10;Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or&#10;a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot&#10;expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is&#10;suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed&#10;counts against its duration.&#10;&#10;***Targeted Effects***. Spells and other magical effects, such as *magic&#10;missile* and *charm person*, that target a creature or an object in the&#10;sphere have no effect on that target.&#10;&#10;***Areas of Magic***. The area of another spell or magical effect, such&#10;as *fireball*, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an&#10;area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is&#10;suppressed. For example, the flames created by a *wall of fire* are&#10;suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap&#10;is large enough.&#10;&#10;***Spells***. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or&#10;an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in&#10;it.&#10;&#10;***Magic Items***. The properties and powers of magic items are&#10;suppressed in the sphere. For example, a *+1 longsword* in the sphere&#10;functions as a nonmagical longsword.&#10;&#10;A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used&#10;against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.&#10;If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere&#10;(for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a&#10;target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be&#10;suppressed as soon as it exits.&#10;&#10;***Magical Travel***. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in&#10;the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point&#10;for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane&#10;of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as&#10;that created by the *rope trick* spell, temporarily closes while in the&#10;sphere.&#10;&#10;***Creatures and Objects***. A creature or object summoned or created by&#10;magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature&#10;instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer&#10;within the sphere.&#10;&#10;***Dispel Magic***. Spells and magical effects such as *dispel magic*&#10;have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different&#10;*antimagic field* spells don’t nullify each other.">

  <outline text="Antipathy/Sympathy" _note="*8th-level enchantment*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 hour&#10;&#10;**Range:** 60 feet&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the&#10;*antipathy* effect or a drop of honey for the *sympathy* effect)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** 10 days&#10;&#10;This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target&#10;something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or&#10;an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of&#10;intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You&#10;invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the&#10;specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as&#10;the aura’s effect.&#10;&#10;***Antipathy***. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you&#10;designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the&#10;target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet&#10;of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become&#10;frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target&#10;or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature&#10;must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it&#10;can’t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the&#10;target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the&#10;creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or&#10;moves within 60 feet of it.&#10;&#10;***Sympathy***. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel&#10;an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or&#10;able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within&#10;60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use&#10;its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach&#10;of the target. When the creature has done so, it can’t willingly move&#10;away from the target.&#10;&#10;If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the&#10;affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as&#10;described below.&#10;&#10;***Ending the Effect***. If an affected creature ends its turn while not&#10;within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a&#10;Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer&#10;affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or&#10;attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is&#10;allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell&#10;persists.&#10;&#10;A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it&#10;for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.">

The eye can look in every&#10;direction.&#10;&#10;As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There&#10;is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can’t&#10;enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s&#10;movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in&#10;diameter.">

  <outline text="Arcane Hand" _note="*5th-level evocation*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 action&#10;&#10;**Range:** 120 feet&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute&#10;&#10;You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an&#10;unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the&#10;spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements&#10;of your own hand.&#10;&#10;The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit&#10;point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a&#10;Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill&#10;its space.&#10;&#10;When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns,&#10;you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following&#10;effects with it.&#10;&#10;***Clenched Fist***. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5&#10;feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game&#10;statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.&#10;&#10;***Forceful Hand***. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet&#10;of it in a direction you choose.&#10;&#10;Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength&#10;(Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you&#10;have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target&#10;up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting&#10;ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet&#10;of it.&#10;&#10;***Grasping Hand***. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller&#10;creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to&#10;resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have&#10;advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can&#10;use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target&#10;takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability&#10;modifier.&#10;&#10;***Interposing Hand***. The hand interposes itself between you and a&#10;creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The&#10;hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half&#10;cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space&#10;if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength&#10;score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score,&#10;the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space&#10;is difficult terrain for the target.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of&#10;6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases&#10;by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each&#10;slot level above 5th.">

You and the creatures you designate&#10;when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set&#10;a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses&#10;this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken&#10;or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting *knock* on the object&#10;suppresses *arcane lock* for 10 minutes.&#10;&#10;While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or&#10;force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.">

It&#10;lasts for the duration.&#10;&#10;When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target&#10;of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes&#10;3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on&#10;each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see&#10;and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.">

The target can be a&#10;willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by&#10;another creature.&#10;&#10;When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects.&#10;The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same&#10;creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it&#10;each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.&#10;&#10;***False Aura***. You change the way the target appears to spells and&#10;magical effects, such as *detect magic*, that detect magical auras. You&#10;can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear&#10;nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to&#10;belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this&#10;effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any&#10;creature that handles the item.&#10;&#10;***Mask***. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical&#10;effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or&#10;the trigger of a *symbol* spell. You choose a creature type and other&#10;spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of&#10;that type or of that alignment.">

  <outline text="Astral Projection" _note="*9th-level necromancy*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 hour&#10;&#10;**Range:** 10 feet&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell,&#10;you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately&#10;carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell&#10;consumes)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Special&#10;&#10;You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral&#10;bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted&#10;if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is&#10;unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food&#10;or air and doesn’t age.&#10;&#10;Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way,&#10;replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal&#10;difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between&#10;your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after&#10;1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the&#10;tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is&#10;cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states&#10;that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.&#10;&#10;Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass&#10;through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new&#10;plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your&#10;body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you&#10;to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a&#10;separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have&#10;no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to&#10;it.&#10;&#10;The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to&#10;dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its&#10;physical body, and it awakens.&#10;&#10;The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A&#10;successful *dispel magic* spell used against an astral or physical body&#10;ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its&#10;astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If&#10;the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the&#10;creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended&#10;animation.&#10;&#10;If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in&#10;their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies,&#10;usually by dropping to 0 hit points.">

The GM chooses from&#10;the following possible omens:&#10;&#10;-   *Weal*, for good results&#10;-   *Woe*, for bad results&#10;-   *Weal and woe*, for both good and bad results&#10;-   *Nothing*, for results that aren’t especially good or bad&#10;&#10;The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that&#10;might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or&#10;the loss or gain of a companion.&#10;&#10;If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long&#10;rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the&#10;first that you get a random reading.

The&#10;target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or&#10;less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the&#10;ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it&#10;gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so&#10;forth, and it gains senses similar to a human’s. Your GM chooses&#10;statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics&#10;for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.&#10;&#10;The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you&#10;or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition&#10;ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you,&#10;based on how you treated it while it was charmed.">

When you cast this&#10;spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:&#10;&#10;-   Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage&#10;    on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.&#10;-   While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against&#10;    you.&#10;-   While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the&#10;    start of each of its turns.

  <outline text="Call Lightning" _note="*3rd-level conjuration*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 action&#10;&#10;**Range:** 120 feet&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes&#10;&#10;A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall&#10;with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range&#10;directly above you. The spell fails if you can’t see a point in the air&#10;where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room&#10;that can’t accommodate the cloud).&#10;&#10;When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A&#10;bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each&#10;creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw.&#10;A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much&#10;damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends,&#10;you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again,&#10;targeting the same point or a different one.&#10;&#10;If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the&#10;spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a&#10;new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of&#10;4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level&#10;above 3rd.">

Each&#10;humanoid in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose&#10;within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to&#10;fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving&#10;throw, choose one of the following two effects.&#10;&#10;You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or&#10;frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes,&#10;provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your&#10;choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target&#10;is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends&#10;being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again,&#10;unless the GM rules otherwise.">

It must make a&#10;Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your&#10;companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed&#10;by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything&#10;harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly&#10;acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by&#10;you.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***.

Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with&#10;the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage,&#10;and it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until&#10;then, the hand clings to the target.&#10;&#10;If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls&#10;against you until the end of your next turn.&#10;&#10;This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),&#10;11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).">

The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it&#10;can’t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.&#10;&#10;When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the&#10;chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your&#10;action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.&#10;&#10;A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from&#10;*see invisibility* or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about&#10;the size of your fist.">

  <outline text="Clone" _note="*8th-level necromancy*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 hour&#10;&#10;**Range:** Touch&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and at least&#10;1 cubic inch of flesh of the creature that is to be cloned, which the&#10;spell consumes, and a vessel worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable&#10;lid and is large enough to hold a Medium creature, such as a huge urn,&#10;coffin, mud-filled cyst in the ground, or crystal container filled with&#10;salt water)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Instantaneous&#10;&#10;This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard&#10;against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full&#10;size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone&#10;be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures&#10;indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.&#10;&#10;At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its&#10;soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing&#10;to return.&#10;&#10;The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same&#10;personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original’s&#10;equipment. The original creature’s physical remains, if they still&#10;exist, become inert and can’t thereafter be restored to life, since the&#10;creature’s soul is elsewhere.">

The fog spreads around&#10;corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the&#10;fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.&#10;&#10;When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or&#10;starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving&#10;throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as&#10;much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they&#10;hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.&#10;&#10;The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns,&#10;rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than&#10;air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***.

The&#10;target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on&#10;its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it&#10;doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful&#10;to it.&#10;&#10;Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a&#10;command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines&#10;how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the&#10;spell ends.&#10;&#10;***Approach***. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most&#10;direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.&#10;&#10;***Drop***. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its&#10;turn.&#10;&#10;***Flee***. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the&#10;fastest available means.&#10;&#10;***Grovel***. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.&#10;&#10;***Halt***. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions.&#10;&#10;A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it&#10;must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain&#10;in the air.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of&#10;2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each&#10;slot level above 1st.

You must ask your questions&#10;before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.&#10;&#10;Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive&#10;“unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies&#10;beyond the deity’s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be&#10;misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the GM might offer a&#10;short phrase as an answer instead.&#10;&#10;If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long&#10;rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the&#10;first that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.">

In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land&#10;within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings,&#10;the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn’t function where&#10;nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.&#10;&#10;You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about&#10;any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:&#10;&#10;-   terrain and bodies of water&#10;-   prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples&#10;-   powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead&#10;-   influence from other planes of existence&#10;-   buildings&#10;&#10;For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the&#10;area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the&#10;location of any nearby towns.">

You also understand any written language that&#10;you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are&#10;written.

A target automatically succeeds on&#10;this saving throw if it can’t be charmed. On a failed save, a target is&#10;affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action&#10;on each of your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to&#10;you. Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible&#10;to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action&#10;before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom&#10;saving to try to end the effect.&#10;&#10;A target isn’t compelled to move into an obviously  deadly hazard, such&#10;as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the&#10;designated direction.">

Contacting this extraplanar&#10;intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this&#10;spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take&#10;6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While&#10;insane, you can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures&#10;say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. A *greater restoration*&#10;spell cast on you ends this effect.&#10;&#10;On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You&#10;must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each&#10;question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,”&#10;“irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the&#10;question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might&#10;instead offer a short phrase as an answer.">

Make a melee spell attack against a&#10;creature within your reach. On a hit, the target is poisoned.&#10;&#10;At the end of each of the poisoned target’s turns, the target must make&#10;a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these&#10;saves, it is no longer poisoned, and the spell ends. If the target fails&#10;three of these saves, the target is no longer poisoned, but choose one&#10;of the diseases below.

The creature’s flesh decays. The creature has&#10;disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.&#10;&#10;***Mindfire***. The creature’s mind becomes feverish. The creature has&#10;disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and&#10;the creature behaves as if under the effects of the *confusion* spell&#10;during combat.&#10;&#10;***Seizure***. The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has&#10;disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack&#10;rolls that use Dexterity.&#10;&#10;***Slimy Doom***. The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The&#10;creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving&#10;throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned&#10;until the end of its next turn.">

You cast that&#10;spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting *contingency*,&#10;expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come&#10;into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance&#10;occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For&#10;example, a *contingency* cast with *water breathing* might stipulate&#10;that *water breathing* comes into effect when you are engulfed in water&#10;or a similar liquid.&#10;&#10;The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is&#10;met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then&#10;*contingency* ends.&#10;&#10;The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally&#10;target others. You can use only one *contingency* spell at a time. If&#10;you cast this spell again, the effect of another *contingency* spell on&#10;you ends. Also, *contingency* ends on you if its material component is&#10;ever not on your person.">

You can choose from&#10;any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on&#10;your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.&#10;&#10;***Flood***. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area&#10;to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the&#10;flooding water spills over onto dry land.&#10;&#10;If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a&#10;20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other&#10;and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path&#10;are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles&#10;struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.&#10;&#10;The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a&#10;different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on&#10;the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.&#10;&#10;***Part Water***. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a&#10;trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated&#10;water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell&#10;ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in&#10;the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water&#10;level is restored.&#10;&#10;***Redirect Flow***. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a&#10;direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up&#10;walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as&#10;you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its&#10;flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the&#10;direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different&#10;effect.&#10;&#10;***Whirlpool***. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet&#10;square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of&#10;the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base,&#10;up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object&#10;in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward&#10;it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength&#10;(Athletics) check against your spell save DC.&#10;&#10;When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts&#10;its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save,&#10;the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex&#10;until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half&#10;damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex&#10;can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described&#10;above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.&#10;&#10;The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object&#10;takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains&#10;in the vortex.">

You decide&#10;what action the creature will take and where it will move during its&#10;next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a&#10;particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature&#10;only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the&#10;creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.&#10;&#10;The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops&#10;obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the&#10;creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature&#10;before the current 24-hour period ends.

Either way, the target knows that you are&#10;probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another&#10;creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make&#10;an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it&#10;succeeds, the spell ends.&#10;&#10;Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the&#10;course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part&#10;of an interrogation.&#10;&#10;You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures&#10;you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the&#10;duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell&#10;can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other&#10;than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a&#10;creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak&#10;any language.&#10;&#10;Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its&#10;thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you&#10;can’t see it, but it must still be within range.">

You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller&#10;and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body&#10;type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of&#10;limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.&#10;&#10;The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical&#10;inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your&#10;outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would&#10;feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to&#10;appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to&#10;touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.&#10;&#10;To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to&#10;inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence&#10;(Investigation) check against your spell save DC.">

Choose a creature known to you as&#10;the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of&#10;existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be&#10;contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a&#10;trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger&#10;is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.&#10;&#10;If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams&#10;and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through&#10;the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment&#10;of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The&#10;messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of&#10;the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If&#10;the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and&#10;can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall&#10;asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.&#10;&#10;You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the&#10;target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than&#10;ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a&#10;failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that&#10;lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents the target from&#10;gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes&#10;up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.&#10;&#10;If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar&#10;portion of the target’s body, the target makes its saving throw with&#10;disadvantage.">

For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the&#10;ground in a 100-foot radius circle centered on that point and shakes&#10;creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.&#10;&#10;The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.&#10;&#10;Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a&#10;Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s&#10;concentration is broken.&#10;&#10;When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend&#10;concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a&#10;Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.&#10;&#10;This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the&#10;area, as determined by the GM.&#10;&#10;***Fissures***. Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start&#10;of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures&#10;open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet&#10;wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite&#10;side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed&#10;on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully&#10;saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.&#10;&#10;A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically&#10;collapse (see below).&#10;&#10;***Structures***. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any&#10;structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell&#10;and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a&#10;structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages&#10;nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s&#10;height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the&#10;creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried&#10;in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action&#10;to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the&#10;nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as&#10;much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.">

Choose either a creature or an&#10;object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it&#10;can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no&#10;effect.&#10;&#10;If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying&#10;changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns&#10;to normal size at once.&#10;&#10;***Enlarge***. The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its&#10;weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one&#10;category- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room&#10;for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the&#10;maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the&#10;target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.&#10;The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these&#10;weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra&#10;damage.&#10;&#10;***Reduce***. The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its&#10;weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its&#10;size by one category-from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell&#10;ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength&#10;saving throws. The target’s weapons also shrink to match its new size.&#10;While these weapons are reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4&#10;less damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).">

You can see and&#10;hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and&#10;you can’t see anything more than 60 feet away.&#10;&#10;While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by&#10;other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren’t on the Ethereal&#10;Plane can’t perceive you and can’t interact with you, unless a special&#10;ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.&#10;&#10;You ignore all objects and effects that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane,&#10;allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you&#10;originated from.&#10;&#10;When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated&#10;from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a&#10;solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted&#10;to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force&#10;damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.&#10;&#10;This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal&#10;Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such as one of the Outer&#10;Planes.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of&#10;8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures&#10;(including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be&#10;within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.">

On each of its turns,&#10;the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you&#10;by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to&#10;move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you&#10;where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.&#10;&#10;***Sickened***. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability&#10;checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom&#10;saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.">

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has&#10;the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or&#10;fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.&#10;&#10;Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your&#10;commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own&#10;turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.&#10;&#10;When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind&#10;no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.&#10;&#10;While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you  can communicate with&#10;it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your&#10;familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next&#10;turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has.&#10;During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.&#10;&#10;As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears&#10;into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you&#10;can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed,&#10;you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of&#10;you.&#10;&#10;You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell&#10;while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new&#10;form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar&#10;transforms into the chosen creature.&#10;&#10;Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can&#10;deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be&#10;within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the&#10;spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use&#10;your attack modifier for the roll.">

Appearing&#10;in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you&#10;choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM&#10;might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the&#10;statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend&#10;(your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed&#10;has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it&#10;gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you&#10;speak.&#10;&#10;Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have&#10;an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit.&#10;While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that&#10;targets only you also target your steed.&#10;&#10;When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no&#10;physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action,&#10;causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again&#10;summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.&#10;&#10;While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each&#10;other telepathically.&#10;&#10;You can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an&#10;action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it&#10;to disappear.">

A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that&#10;would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or&#10;undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator.&#10;Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the *alarm* spell, a&#10;*glyph of warding*, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a&#10;natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden&#10;sinkhole.&#10;&#10;This spell merely reveals that a trap is present.&#10;&#10;You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general&#10;nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.">

If the target’s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a&#10;Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its&#10;flesh begins to harden.

The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily&#10;obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or&#10;greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***.

  <outline text="Forbiddance" _note="*6th-level abjuration (ritual)*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 10 minutes&#10;&#10;**Range:** Touch&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and&#10;powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** 1 day&#10;&#10;You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000&#10;square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For&#10;the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals,&#10;such as those created by the *gate* spell, to enter the area. The spell&#10;proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures&#10;from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane,&#10;Feywild, Shadowfell, or the *plane shift* spell.&#10;&#10;In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when&#10;you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials,&#10;elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the&#10;spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the&#10;creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you&#10;cast this spell).&#10;&#10;When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that&#10;speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the&#10;spell.&#10;&#10;The spell’s area can’t overlap with the area of another *forbiddance*&#10;spell. If you cast *forbiddance* every day for 30 days in the same&#10;location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material&#10;components are consumed on the last casting.">

The&#10;prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.&#10;&#10;A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is&#10;made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.&#10;&#10;A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating&#10;a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and&#10;blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.&#10;&#10;When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the&#10;cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or&#10;those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center&#10;of the area until they are completely outside the area.&#10;&#10;A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the&#10;creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the&#10;cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the&#10;creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature&#10;can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage&#10;also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.&#10;&#10;This spell can’t be dispelled by *dispel magic*.">

For the duration, the target can’t be surprised&#10;and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.&#10;Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against&#10;the target for the duration.&#10;&#10;This spell immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration&#10;ends.">

For the duration, the target’s movement is&#10;unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects&#10;can neither reduce the target’s speed nor cause the target to be&#10;paralyzed or restrained.&#10;&#10;The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape&#10;from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it&#10;grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target’s&#10;movement or attacks.">

  <outline text="Freezing Sphere" _note="*6th-level evocation*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 action&#10;&#10;**Range:** 300 feet&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Instantaneous&#10;&#10;A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of&#10;your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot radius sphere.&#10;Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On&#10;a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save,&#10;it takes half as much damage.&#10;&#10;If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally&#10;water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a&#10;depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1&#10;minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are&#10;trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a&#10;Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.&#10;&#10;You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you&#10;wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch,&#10;appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe&#10;to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling&#10;(to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same&#10;effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe&#10;down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already&#10;shattered, it explodes.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of&#10;7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level&#10;above 6th.">

The spell&#10;ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature&#10;isn’t affected.&#10;&#10;While in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying&#10;speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another&#10;creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has&#10;advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The&#10;target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere&#10;cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The&#10;target can’t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or&#10;otherwise incapacitated.&#10;&#10;While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk or manipulate&#10;objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped,&#10;used, or otherwise interacted with.

The&#10;portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in&#10;diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The&#10;portal lasts for the duration.&#10;&#10;The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel&#10;through the portal is possible only by moving through its front.&#10;Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane,&#10;appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.&#10;&#10;Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this&#10;spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.&#10;&#10;When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature&#10;(a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a&#10;plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named&#10;creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the&#10;nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special&#10;power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems&#10;appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.">

If the creature can understand you, it&#10;must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the&#10;duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic&#10;damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your&#10;instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t&#10;understand you is unaffected by the spell.&#10;&#10;You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would&#10;result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell&#10;ends.&#10;&#10;You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A *remove&#10;curse*, *greater restoration*, or *wish* spell also ends it.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of&#10;7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year.

For the duration, the target is&#10;protected from decay and can’t become undead.&#10;&#10;The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target&#10;from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t&#10;count against the time limit of spells such as *raise dead*.">

A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a&#10;giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a&#10;giant scorpion.&#10;&#10;Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on&#10;your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and&#10;resolves their actions and movement.&#10;&#10;A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to&#10;0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.&#10;&#10;The GM might allow you to choose different targets.

Such a spell can target creatures and objects&#10;within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the&#10;area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such&#10;spells.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***.

  <outline text="Glyph of Warding" _note="*3rd-level abjuration*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 hour&#10;&#10;**Range:** Touch&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200&#10;gp, which the spell consumes)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered&#10;&#10;When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other&#10;creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor&#10;or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a&#10;scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover&#10;an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is&#10;moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is&#10;broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.&#10;&#10;The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence&#10;(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.&#10;&#10;You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs&#10;inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or&#10;standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph,&#10;approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the&#10;object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an&#10;object, the most common triggers include opening that object,&#10;approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or&#10;reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.&#10;&#10;You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under&#10;certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as&#10;height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to&#10;affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions&#10;for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a&#10;certain password.&#10;&#10;When you inscribe the glyph, choose *explosive runes* or a *spell&#10;glyph*.&#10;&#10;***Explosive Runes***. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical&#10;energy in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere&#10;spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity&#10;saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or&#10;thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the&#10;glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.&#10;&#10;***Spell Glyph***. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower&#10;in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must&#10;target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no&#10;immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the&#10;stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature&#10;that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is&#10;centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or&#10;creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to&#10;the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it&#10;lasts until the end of its full duration.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of&#10;4th level or higher, the damage of an *explosive runes* glyph increases&#10;by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a *spell glyph*, you&#10;can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the&#10;*glyph of warding*.">

The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped&#10;as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing&#10;the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area&#10;while you are casting the spell.&#10;&#10;When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are&#10;unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also&#10;specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to&#10;these effects.&#10;&#10;*Guards and wards* creates the following effects within the warded area.&#10;&#10;***Corridors***. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily&#10;obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage&#10;offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a&#10;creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite&#10;direction from the one it chooses.&#10;&#10;***Doors***. All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if&#10;sealed by an *arcane lock* spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten&#10;doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of&#10;the *minor illusion* spell) to make them appear as plain sections of&#10;wall.&#10;&#10;***Stairs***. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to&#10;bottom, as the *web* spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they&#10;are burned or torn away while *guards and wards* lasts.&#10;&#10;***Other Spell Effect***. You can place your choice of one of the&#10;following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.&#10;&#10;-   Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple&#10;    program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.&#10;-   Place magic mouth in two locations.&#10;-   Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the&#10;    places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by&#10;    wind while guards and wards lasts.&#10;-   Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room.&#10;-   Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5&#10;    feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area&#10;    receives the suggestion mentally.&#10;&#10;The whole warded area radiates magic. A *dispel magic* cast on a&#10;specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.&#10;&#10;You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting&#10;this spell there every day for one year.">

Some of these&#10;effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the&#10;effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity&#10;or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When&#10;a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first&#10;time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving&#10;throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it&#10;leaves the area.&#10;&#10;***Courage***. Affected creatures can’t be frightened while in the area.&#10;&#10;***Darkness***.

If the&#10;difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the&#10;illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your&#10;spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for&#10;what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.">

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be&#10;bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you&#10;cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need&#10;to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t&#10;locate or perceive the target.&#10;&#10;When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of&#10;imprisonment.&#10;&#10;***Burial***. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere&#10;of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target.&#10;Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or&#10;use planar travel to get into or out of it.&#10;&#10;The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral&#10;orb.&#10;&#10;***Chaining***. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the&#10;target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it&#10;can’t move or be moved by any means until then.&#10;&#10;The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of&#10;precious metal.&#10;&#10;***Hedged Prison***. The spell transports the target into a tiny&#10;demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The&#10;demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined&#10;structure or area of your choice.&#10;&#10;The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature&#10;representation of the prison made from jade.&#10;&#10;***Minimus Containment***. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and&#10;is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass&#10;through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other&#10;creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means&#10;of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken&#10;while the spell remains in effect.&#10;&#10;The special component for this version of the spell is a large,&#10;transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.&#10;&#10;***Slumber***. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special&#10;component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific&#10;herbs.&#10;&#10;***Ending the Spell***. During the casting of the spell, in any of its&#10;versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end&#10;and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate&#10;as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable&#10;and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a&#10;creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on&#10;observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as&#10;level, class, or hit points.&#10;&#10;A *dispel magic* spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a&#10;9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component&#10;used to create it.&#10;&#10;You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at&#10;a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target&#10;of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.">

The cloud&#10;spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the&#10;duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles&#10;per hour) disperses it.&#10;&#10;When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving&#10;throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as&#10;much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving&#10;throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or&#10;ends its turn there.&#10;&#10;The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you&#10;choose at the start of each of your turns.">

While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have&#10;advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature&#10;makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful&#10;save, the spell ends.">

The spell brings to your&#10;mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named.&#10;The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even&#10;secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named&#10;isn’t of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more&#10;information you already have about the thing, the more precise and&#10;detailed the information you receive is.&#10;&#10;The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative&#10;language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the&#10;spell might yield this information: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand&#10;touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones.&#10;Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the&#10;true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word *Rudnogg* on the&#10;lips.”">

While your&#10;soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if&#10;you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The&#10;only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of&#10;the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the&#10;spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.&#10;&#10;You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you&#10;can see (creatures warded by a *protection from evil and good* or *magic&#10;circle* spell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma&#10;saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and&#10;the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the&#10;target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to&#10;possess it again for 24 hours.&#10;&#10;Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics&#10;are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your&#10;alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain&#10;the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class&#10;levels, you can’t use any of its class features.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container&#10;using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.&#10;&#10;While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host&#10;body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the&#10;host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in&#10;it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against&#10;your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if&#10;it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.&#10;&#10;If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately&#10;returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you&#10;or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If&#10;another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the&#10;creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100&#10;feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.&#10;&#10;When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.">

Choose an object that you can&#10;see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak&#10;the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered&#10;over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that&#10;will trigger the spell to deliver your message.&#10;&#10;When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and&#10;recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If&#10;the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth&#10;(for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so&#10;that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast&#10;this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or&#10;it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.&#10;&#10;The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you&#10;like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur&#10;within 30 feet of the object.

You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance&#10;shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any&#10;creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the&#10;extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can&#10;open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed,&#10;the portal is invisible.&#10;&#10;Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond.&#10;The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.&#10;&#10;You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50&#10;cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and&#10;decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a&#10;nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100&#10;near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual&#10;appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely&#10;obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal&#10;human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action&#10;that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch&#10;things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine,&#10;and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave&#10;it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into&#10;smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures&#10;inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces&#10;nearest to the entrance.">

The image appears at a&#10;spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems&#10;completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate&#10;to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause&#10;damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature,&#10;or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).&#10;&#10;As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action&#10;to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image&#10;changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements&#10;appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a&#10;creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be&#10;walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds&#10;at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.&#10;&#10;Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,&#10;because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to&#10;examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful&#10;Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a&#10;creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see&#10;through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the&#10;creature.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***.

Using your movement, you step into the stone at&#10;a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or&#10;otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.&#10;&#10;While merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and&#10;any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are&#10;made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can&#10;cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your&#10;movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell.&#10;You otherwise can’t move.&#10;&#10;Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial&#10;destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer&#10;fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The&#10;stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different&#10;substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If&#10;expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you&#10;first entered.">

As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot&#10;in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.&#10;&#10;This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the&#10;spell can’t restore magic to such an object.">

The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or&#10;cast this spell again.&#10;&#10;If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream.&#10;It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of&#10;drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated&#10;throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different&#10;times before the spell ends.&#10;&#10;If you create an image of an object-such as a chair, muddy footprints,&#10;or a small chest-it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image&#10;can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical&#10;interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things&#10;can pass through it.&#10;&#10;If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the&#10;creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful&#10;Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The terrain’s general shape&#10;remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to&#10;resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable&#10;terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice&#10;like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.&#10;&#10;Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where&#10;none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.&#10;&#10;The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements,&#10;so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or&#10;otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory&#10;terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area&#10;disappears immediately.&#10;&#10;Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s&#10;true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while&#10;the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can still&#10;physically interact with the illusion.">

Until the&#10;spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions,&#10;shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You&#10;can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.&#10;&#10;Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s&#10;duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one&#10;of your duplicates.&#10;&#10;If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the&#10;attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8&#10;or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.&#10;&#10;A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits&#10;a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed&#10;only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects.&#10;The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.&#10;&#10;A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it relies on&#10;senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive&#10;illusions as false, as with truesight.">

The double lasts for the duration, but&#10;the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.&#10;&#10;You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your&#10;speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.&#10;&#10;You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were&#10;located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can&#10;switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again.

One creature that&#10;you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the&#10;creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the&#10;target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is&#10;incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear&#10;you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell&#10;ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified.&#10;&#10;While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event&#10;that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more&#10;than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event,&#10;allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting&#10;detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a&#10;memory of some other event.&#10;&#10;You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected,&#10;and it must be able to understand your language for the modified&#10;memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your&#10;description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the&#10;modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the&#10;modified memories take hold when the spell ends.&#10;&#10;A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves,&#10;particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural&#10;inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such&#10;as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself&#10;in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a&#10;modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant&#10;manner.&#10;&#10;A *remove curse* or *greater restoration* spell cast on the target&#10;restores the creature’s true memory.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th&#10;level or higher, you can alter the target’s memories of an event that&#10;took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year&#10;ago (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).">

Until the spell ends,&#10;dim light fills the cylinder.&#10;&#10;When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or&#10;starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause&#10;searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes&#10;2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a&#10;successful one.&#10;&#10;A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it&#10;also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different&#10;form until it leaves the spell’s light.&#10;&#10;On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action&#10;to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***.

You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or&#10;fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent&#10;of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So,&#10;if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet&#10;high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a&#10;trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these&#10;changes to complete.&#10;&#10;At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you&#10;can choose a new area of terrain to affect.&#10;&#10;Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the&#10;area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.&#10;&#10;This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks&#10;and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you&#10;shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.&#10;&#10;Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved&#10;earth carries any plants along with it.">

The being must be known to&#10;you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic&#10;power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to&#10;it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within&#10;range. If you know a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name&#10;when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get&#10;a different creature anyway (GM’s choice).&#10;&#10;When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any&#10;particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in&#10;exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task&#10;could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a&#10;battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray&#10;into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to&#10;bargain for its services.&#10;&#10;Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable&#10;donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might&#10;demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might&#10;exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.&#10;&#10;As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a&#10;payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000&#10;gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000&#10;gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances&#10;under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the&#10;creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.&#10;Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment,&#10;while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures&#10;rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.&#10;&#10;After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration&#10;of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after&#10;reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If&#10;you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the&#10;creature immediately returns to its home plane.&#10;&#10;A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it,&#10;receiving a full share of experience points awarded.">

The creature must be within range for the&#10;entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned&#10;into the center of an inverted *magic circle* in order to keep it&#10;trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the&#10;target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound&#10;to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created&#10;by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the&#10;duration of this spell.&#10;&#10;A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its&#10;ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an&#10;adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature&#10;obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to&#10;you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If&#10;the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell&#10;ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane&#10;of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns&#10;to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***.

You can specify a target&#10;destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental&#10;Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine&#10;Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to&#10;reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of&#10;Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the&#10;Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle&#10;on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle.&#10;If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you&#10;transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the&#10;circle.&#10;&#10;You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane.&#10;Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack&#10;against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If&#10;the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on&#10;the plane of existence you specify.

An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid&#10;the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with&#10;0 hit points.&#10;&#10;The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to&#10;0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge&#10;rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if&#10;it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics,&#10;including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the&#10;chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.&#10;&#10;The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to&#10;its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had&#10;before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit&#10;points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as&#10;the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit&#10;points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.&#10;&#10;The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of&#10;its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action&#10;that requires hands or speech.&#10;&#10;The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate,&#10;use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.">

Alternatively, you can shape the wall&#10;into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose&#10;within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you&#10;position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a&#10;creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are&#10;wasted.&#10;&#10;The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for&#10;an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you&#10;cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm.&#10;If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it&#10;or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution&#10;saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.&#10;&#10;The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a&#10;creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one&#10;layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches&#10;through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or&#10;be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.&#10;&#10;The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red&#10;to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed,&#10;it remains so for the duration of the spell. An *antimagic field* has no&#10;effect on it.&#10;&#10;-   ***Red***. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or&#10;    half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in&#10;    place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The&#10;    layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.&#10;-   ***Orange***. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save,&#10;    or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in&#10;    place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer&#10;    is destroyed by a strong wind.&#10;-   ***Yellow***. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed&#10;    save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be&#10;    destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.&#10;-   ***Green***. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save,&#10;    or half as much damage on a successful one. A *passwall* spell, or&#10;    another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a&#10;    solid surface, destroys this layer.&#10;-   ***Blue***. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or&#10;    half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed&#10;    by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.&#10;-   ***Indigo***. On a failed save, the creature is restrained.

The successes and failures&#10;    don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature&#10;    collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can’t&#10;    be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light&#10;    shed by a *daylight* spell or a similar spell of equal or higher&#10;    level.&#10;-   ***Violet***. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must&#10;    then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A&#10;    successful save ends the blindness.

The area is a cube that&#10;can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The&#10;spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.&#10;&#10;When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell&#10;provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:&#10;&#10;-   Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.&#10;-   The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing&#10;    vision (including darkvision) through it.&#10;-   Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the&#10;    protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.&#10;-   Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.&#10;-   Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.&#10;-   Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell&#10;    on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of&#10;5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet&#10;for each slot level beyond 4th.

It must be no larger than a&#10;30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion&#10;behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up&#10;to 5 minutes.&#10;&#10;When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into&#10;existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion&#10;finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes.&#10;After this time, the illusion can be activated again.&#10;&#10;The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like,&#10;though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur&#10;within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of&#10;yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped&#10;door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says&#10;the correct word or phrase.&#10;&#10;Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,&#10;because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to&#10;examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful&#10;Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a&#10;creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see&#10;through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.">

On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its&#10;senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses,&#10;you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.&#10;&#10;Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,&#10;because things can pass through it.

If its soul is free&#10;and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.&#10;&#10;This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting&#10;the creature when it died. It doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases,&#10;curses, and the like; if such effects aren’t removed prior to casting&#10;the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.&#10;&#10;This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.&#10;&#10;Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to&#10;all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the&#10;target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it&#10;disappears.&#10;&#10;Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for&#10;one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you&#10;can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls,&#10;ability checks, and saving throws.">

All creatures and objects that aren’t&#10;somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top&#10;of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity&#10;saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the&#10;fall.&#10;&#10;If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall,&#10;falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a&#10;normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the&#10;area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly,&#10;for the duration.&#10;&#10;At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back&#10;down.">

One end of the&#10;rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to&#10;the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to&#10;an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.&#10;&#10;The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the&#10;rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures.&#10;The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from&#10;view outside the space.&#10;&#10;Attacks and spells can’t cross through the entrance into or out of the&#10;extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through&#10;a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.&#10;&#10;Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell&#10;ends.">

The target must make a Wisdom saving&#10;throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of&#10;physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re casting&#10;this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be&#10;observed.&#10;&#10;**Table- Scrying Save Modifier**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this&#10;spell against it again for 24 hours.&#10;&#10;On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet&#10;of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were&#10;there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it&#10;for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the&#10;sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.&#10;&#10;Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen&#10;before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at&#10;that location and doesn’t move.">

  <outline text="Secret Chest" _note="*4th-level conjuration*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 action&#10;&#10;**Range:** Touch&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet,&#10;constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny&#10;replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Instantaneous&#10;&#10;You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must&#10;touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material&#10;component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of&#10;nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).&#10;&#10;While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and&#10;touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space&#10;on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the&#10;Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the&#10;replica.&#10;&#10;After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the&#10;spell’s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if&#10;the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the&#10;spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the&#10;Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.">

  <outline text="Seeming" _note="*5th-level illusion*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 action&#10;&#10;**Range:** 30 feet&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S&#10;&#10;**Duration:** 8 hours&#10;&#10;This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of&#10;creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose&#10;a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma&#10;saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.&#10;&#10;The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor,&#10;weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter&#10;or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a&#10;target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic&#10;arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to&#10;you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to&#10;dismiss it sooner.&#10;&#10;The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical&#10;inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a&#10;creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches&#10;it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you&#10;use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who&#10;reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly&#10;still in midair.&#10;&#10;A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an&#10;Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it&#10;succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.">

The creature hears the message in its mind,&#10;recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like&#10;manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores&#10;of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.&#10;&#10;You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of&#10;existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is&#10;a 5 percent chance that the message doesn’t arrive.">

When you cast the spell and&#10;touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by&#10;divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by&#10;divination spells.&#10;&#10;If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended&#10;animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.&#10;&#10;You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be&#10;anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of&#10;the target. Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque&#10;awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.">

  <outline text="Shapechange" _note="*9th-level transmutation*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 action&#10;&#10;**Range:** Self&#10;&#10;**Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which&#10;you must place on your head before you cast the spell)&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour&#10;&#10;You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new&#10;form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level&#10;or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must&#10;have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an&#10;average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the&#10;Spellcasting trait.&#10;&#10;Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen&#10;creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and&#10;Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw&#10;proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the&#10;creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its&#10;statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of&#10;yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new&#10;form.&#10;&#10;You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert&#10;to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had&#10;before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit&#10;points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as&#10;the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you&#10;aren’t knocked unconscious.&#10;&#10;You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other&#10;source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically&#10;capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for&#10;example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can&#10;only speak if the creature can normally speak.&#10;&#10;When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the&#10;ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment&#10;functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the&#10;new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and&#10;size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form,&#10;and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the&#10;ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect&#10;in that state.&#10;&#10;During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a&#10;different form following the same restrictions and rules for the&#10;original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points&#10;than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.">

Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere&#10;centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature&#10;takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a&#10;successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone,&#10;crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.&#10;&#10;A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the&#10;damage if it’s in the spell’s area.&#10;&#10;***At Higher Levels***.

For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability&#10;instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks&#10;using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8.

The image appears at a&#10;spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely&#10;visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.&#10;&#10;You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within&#10;range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so&#10;that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you&#10;create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so&#10;that it appears to be walking.&#10;&#10;Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,&#10;because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to&#10;examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful&#10;Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a&#10;creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see&#10;through the image.">

The duplicate is a&#10;creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take&#10;actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be&#10;the same as the original, but it has half the creature’s hit point&#10;maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion&#10;uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is&#10;a construct.&#10;&#10;The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys&#10;your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes&#10;and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to&#10;learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other&#10;abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.&#10;&#10;If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical&#10;laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it&#10;regains.

The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited&#10;by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information&#10;about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can&#10;perceive or have perceived within the past day.

The spell fails if&#10;the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.&#10;&#10;Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The&#10;corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew.&#10;Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is&#10;under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it&#10;or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the&#10;creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse&#10;can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has&#10;happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.">

You can question plants about events in the&#10;spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures&#10;that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.&#10;&#10;You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as&#10;thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the&#10;duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into&#10;difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and&#10;branches to hinder pursuers, for example.&#10;&#10;Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s&#10;discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and&#10;move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.&#10;&#10;If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if&#10;you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to&#10;influence it.&#10;&#10;This spell can cause the plants created by the *entangle* spell to&#10;release a restrained creature.">

Lightning flashes in the area,&#10;thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no&#10;more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a&#10;Constitution saving throw.

Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and&#10;object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.&#10;&#10;***Round 3***. You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike&#10;six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given&#10;creature or object can’t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck&#10;creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6&#10;lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a&#10;successful one.&#10;&#10;***Round 4***. Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under&#10;the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.&#10;&#10;***Round 5-10***. Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the&#10;cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each&#10;creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area&#10;are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the&#10;purposes of maintaining concentration on spells.

Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this&#10;effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the&#10;course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself,&#10;throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously&#10;harmful act ends the spell.&#10;&#10;The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues&#10;the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The&#10;suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the&#10;suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends&#10;when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.&#10;&#10;You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity&#10;during the duration.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can&#10;cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you&#10;choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is&#10;moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is&#10;broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.&#10;&#10;The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation)&#10;check against your spell save DC to find it.&#10;&#10;You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs&#10;inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or&#10;stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching&#10;within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds&#10;it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are&#10;opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or&#10;seeing or reading the glyph.&#10;&#10;You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under&#10;certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical&#10;characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for&#10;example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can&#10;also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who&#10;say a certain password.&#10;&#10;When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its&#10;effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot radius sphere&#10;with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each&#10;creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its&#10;effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a&#10;turn or ends its turn there.&#10;&#10;***Death***. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking&#10;10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a&#10;successful save.&#10;&#10;***Discord***. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a&#10;failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1&#10;minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication&#10;and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.&#10;&#10;***Fear***. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes&#10;frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target&#10;drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from&#10;the glyph on each of its turns, if able.&#10;&#10;***Hopelessness***. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a&#10;failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During&#10;this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful&#10;abilities, spells, or other magical effects.&#10;&#10;***Insanity***. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a&#10;failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane&#10;creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say,&#10;can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement,&#10;which is erratic.&#10;&#10;***Pain***. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and&#10;becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed&#10;save.&#10;&#10;***Sleep***. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls&#10;unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it&#10;takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.&#10;&#10;***Stunning***. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes&#10;stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.">

If you target an&#10;object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it&#10;can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.&#10;&#10;The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the&#10;same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination&#10;determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and&#10;consults the table.&#10;&#10;**Table- Teleport Familiarity**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;***Familiarity***. “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation&#10;circle whose sigil sequence you know. “Associated object” means that you&#10;possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six&#10;months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a royal&#10;suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb.&#10;&#10;“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a place you have&#10;carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. “Seen&#10;casually” is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you&#10;aren’t very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen once,&#10;possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and&#10;appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a&#10;map.&#10;&#10;“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to&#10;scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are&#10;attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.&#10;&#10;***On Target***. You and your group (or the target object) appear where&#10;you want to.&#10;&#10;***Off Target***. You and your group (or the target object) appear a&#10;random distance away from the destination in a random direction.&#10;Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to&#10;be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off&#10;target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off&#10;target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off&#10;target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as&#10;northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you&#10;were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you&#10;could be in trouble.&#10;&#10;***Similar Area***. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in&#10;a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target&#10;area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you&#10;might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply&#10;shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory.&#10;Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell&#10;has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.&#10;&#10;***Mishap***. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult&#10;journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10&#10;force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up&#10;(multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).">

A shimmering portal opens&#10;within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next&#10;turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5&#10;feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if&#10;that space is occupied.&#10;&#10;Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent&#10;teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each&#10;such circle includes a unique sigil sequence-a string of magical runes&#10;arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to&#10;cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on&#10;the Material Plane, determined by the GM.

The transformation lasts&#10;for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If&#10;you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation&#10;lasts until it is dispelled.&#10;&#10;This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit&#10;points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it&#10;succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.&#10;&#10;***Creature into Creature***. If you turn a creature into another kind&#10;of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge&#10;rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the&#10;target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics,&#10;including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the&#10;new form. It retains its alignment and personality.&#10;&#10;The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts&#10;to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it&#10;had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0&#10;hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long&#10;as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit&#10;points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.&#10;&#10;The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of&#10;its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action&#10;that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such&#10;actions.&#10;&#10;The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate,&#10;use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.&#10;&#10;***Object into Creature***. You can turn an object into any kind of&#10;creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s&#10;size and the creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is&#10;friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You&#10;decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature’s&#10;statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.&#10;&#10;If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It&#10;might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.&#10;&#10;***Creature into Object***. If you turn a creature into an object, it&#10;transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that&#10;form, as long as the object’s size is no larger than the creature’s&#10;size. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the&#10;creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends&#10;and it returns to its normal form.">

The&#10;spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was&#10;undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.&#10;&#10;The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists,&#10;in which case you must speak the creature’s name.

The servant&#10;springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within&#10;range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t&#10;attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.&#10;&#10;Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command&#10;the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The&#10;servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as&#10;fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires,&#10;serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant&#10;performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the&#10;task, then waits for your next command.&#10;&#10;If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more&#10;than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.">

The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a&#10;horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating&#10;or resting on a solid surface.

The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten&#10;10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least&#10;one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels&#10;that are only 3 inches thick.&#10;&#10;If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the&#10;creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature&#10;would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another&#10;solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a&#10;success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is&#10;no longer enclosed by the wall.&#10;&#10;The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same&#10;space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or&#10;rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly&#10;supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a&#10;chasm or create a ramp.&#10;&#10;If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the&#10;size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to&#10;create crenellations, battlements, and so on.&#10;&#10;The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus&#10;breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness.&#10;Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected&#10;panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.&#10;&#10;If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration,&#10;the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled.

At the end of each of the frightened creature’s&#10;turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic&#10;damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.">

  <outline text="Wish" _note="*9th-level conjuration*&#10;&#10;**Casting Time:** 1 action&#10;&#10;**Range:** Self&#10;&#10;**Components:** V&#10;&#10;**Duration:** Instantaneous&#10;&#10;*Wish* is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply&#10;speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord&#10;with your desires.&#10;&#10;The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level&#10;or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell,&#10;including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your&#10;choice:&#10;&#10;-   You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic&#10;    item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and&#10;    it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.&#10;-   You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit&#10;    points, and you end all effects on them described in the *greater&#10;    restoration* spell.&#10;-   You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a&#10;    damage type you choose.&#10;-   You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell&#10;    or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make&#10;    yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain&#10;    attack.&#10;-   You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made&#10;    within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes&#10;    itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a *wish* spell&#10;    could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a&#10;    friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with&#10;    advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the&#10;    reroll or the original roll.&#10;&#10;You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above&#10;examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has&#10;great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater&#10;the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This&#10;spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly&#10;achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of&#10;how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead&#10;might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no&#10;longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing&#10;for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to&#10;the presence of the item’s current owner.&#10;&#10;The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than&#10;duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each&#10;time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10&#10;necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or&#10;prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t&#10;3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend&#10;resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining&#10;recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance&#10;that you are unable to cast *wish* ever again if you suffer this stress.">

You and any creatures&#10;that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the&#10;spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you&#10;cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no&#10;effect.&#10;&#10;You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location,&#10;such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you&#10;attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn’t dedicated&#10;to your deity, the spell has no effect.">

They sprang from the&#10;brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and&#10;the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared&#10;put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling&#10;in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.&#10;&#10;The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they&#10;are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.&#10;&#10;**Table- Celtic Deities**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

It’s a brutal clime, and one&#10;that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt&#10;to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too&#10;twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of&#10;raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as&#10;well as they did.

Braving the realms of the dead, seeking&#10;out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in&#10;its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.&#10;&#10;Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in&#10;two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.&#10;&#10;***Spells***. A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to&#10;other planes of existence. *Plane shift* and *gate* can transport&#10;adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different&#10;degrees of precision. *Etherealness* allows adventurers to enter the&#10;Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it&#10;touches-such as the Elemental Planes. And the *astral projection* spell&#10;lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to&#10;the Outer Planes.&#10;&#10;***Portals***. A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar&#10;connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific&#10;location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or&#10;a fog- shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the&#10;interplanar travel. Others are locations- circles of standing stones,&#10;soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in&#10;multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn.&#10;Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very&#10;similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano&#10;(leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane&#10;of Water).">

Its shores, called the Border Ethereal,&#10;overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location&#10;on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane.&#10;Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the *see&#10;invisibility* and *true seeing* spell grant that ability. Some magical&#10;effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal,&#10;particularly effects that use force energy such as *forcecage* and *wall&#10;of force*. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of&#10;swirling mists and colorful fogs.&#10;&#10;The **Astral Plane** is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors&#10;travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and&#10;demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with&#10;swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light&#10;resembling distant stars.

The four&#10;elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land,&#10;sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental&#10;Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their&#10;purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear&#10;water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when&#10;discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just&#10;the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure&#10;elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing&#10;energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.">

    <outline text="Outer Planes" _note="If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the&#10;multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for&#10;such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as&#10;divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes&#10;are best known as the homes of deities.&#10;&#10;When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be&#10;highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally “places” at&#10;all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought&#10;and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the&#10;perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while&#10;extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.&#10;&#10;Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive.&#10;Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to&#10;natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims&#10;of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the&#10;mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely,&#10;effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill&#10;their own needs.&#10;&#10;Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The&#10;perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can&#10;also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to&#10;take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth,&#10;in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take&#10;weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.&#10;&#10;The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that&#10;correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades&#10;of distinction between them.">
      <outline text="Outer Planes" _note="The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the&#10;**Upper Planes**. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in&#10;the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the **Lower&#10;Planes**. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A&#10;plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment&#10;doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance&#10;there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good&#10;Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature&#10;feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.">

      <outline text="Demiplanes" _note="Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique&#10;rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else.&#10;Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by&#10;spells, such as *demiplane*, or generated at the desire of a powerful&#10;deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing&#10;reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as&#10;a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered&#10;through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a&#10;*plane shift* spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the&#10;proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to&#10;acquire. The *gate* spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of&#10;the demiplane.">

  <outline text="Traps" _note="Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb&#10;might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor&#10;and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance&#10;might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among&#10;the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy&#10;game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or&#10;fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.&#10;&#10;A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. **Mechanical&#10;traps** include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms,&#10;whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to&#10;operate. **Magic traps** are either magical device traps or spell traps.&#10;Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps&#10;are spells such as *glyph of warding* and *symbol* that function as&#10;traps.">
    <outline text="Traps in Play" _note="When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is&#10;triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the&#10;characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.">
      <outline text="Triggering a Trap" _note="Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches&#10;something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers&#10;include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor,&#10;pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a&#10;lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area&#10;or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the *glyph of warding*&#10;spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password&#10;that prevents the trap from activating.">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Detecting and Disabling a Trap" _note="Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection.&#10;Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure&#10;plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in&#10;the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect&#10;something that points to a trap’s presence.&#10;&#10;A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it,&#10;disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt&#10;a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare&#10;the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom&#10;(Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the&#10;trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it,&#10;they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to&#10;move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check&#10;for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity&#10;check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.&#10;&#10;Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or&#10;disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s&#10;description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In&#10;addition, *dispel magic* has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A&#10;magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when&#10;you use *dispel magic*.&#10;&#10;In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can&#10;adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As&#10;with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever&#10;play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s&#10;description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate&#10;every possible action that the characters might attempt.&#10;&#10;You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an&#10;ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For&#10;example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the&#10;character has found the trigger and no check is required.&#10;&#10;Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped&#10;treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two&#10;handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison&#10;needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and&#10;making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped.&#10;Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and&#10;push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the&#10;trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the&#10;shield.&#10;&#10;Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed&#10;or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their&#10;lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such&#10;traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret&#10;door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.">

      <outline text="Trap Effects" _note="The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use&#10;of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of&#10;fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to&#10;kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to&#10;trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is&#10;triggered.&#10;&#10;The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the&#10;damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s severity. Use the Trap&#10;Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table&#10;for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.&#10;&#10;A trap intended to be a **setback** is unlikely to kill or seriously&#10;harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a **dangerous** trap is&#10;likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the&#10;indicated levels. A **deadly** trap is likely to kill characters of the&#10;indicated levels.&#10;&#10;**Table- Trap Dangers**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;**Table- Trap Severity**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

      <outline text="Complex Traps" _note="Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they&#10;execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process&#10;of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.&#10;&#10;When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap’s&#10;description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap&#10;activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive&#10;attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or&#10;otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can&#10;be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.&#10;&#10;For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a&#10;complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several&#10;rounds, the room is completely flooded.">

      <outline text="Collapsing Roof" _note="*Mechanical trap*&#10;&#10;This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable&#10;section of a ceiling in place.&#10;&#10;The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two&#10;support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15&#10;Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire harmlessly.&#10;A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with&#10;disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check,&#10;the trap triggers.&#10;&#10;Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely&#10;wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam,&#10;causing the trap to trigger.&#10;&#10;The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see&#10;it can tell that it’s in danger of collapse.&#10;&#10;When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature&#10;in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15&#10;Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed&#10;save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to&#10;spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check&#10;using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character&#10;without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using&#10;any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.&#10;&#10;When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot&#10;square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained,&#10;and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked&#10;prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10&#10;&#10;Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a&#10;success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage&#10;to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot square section of it, freeing any&#10;creature trapped in that section.">

      <outline text="Fire-Breathing Statue" _note="*Magic trap*&#10;&#10;This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure&#10;plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The&#10;statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a&#10;spell.&#10;&#10;The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks&#10;on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the&#10;presence of magic, such as *detect magic*, reveals an aura of evocation&#10;magic around the statue.&#10;&#10;The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the&#10;pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire.&#10;Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw,&#10;taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on&#10;a successful one.&#10;&#10;Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents&#10;the trap from activating.

      <outline text="Pits" _note="*Mechanical trap*&#10;&#10;Four basic pit traps are presented here.&#10;&#10;***Simple Pit***. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The&#10;hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and&#10;camouflaged with dirt and debris.&#10;&#10;The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through&#10;and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s&#10;depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).&#10;&#10;***Hidden Pit***. This pit has a cover constructed from material&#10;identical to the floor around it.&#10;&#10;A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot&#10;traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A&#10;successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to&#10;confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a&#10;pit.&#10;&#10;When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor,&#10;causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10&#10;or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.&#10;&#10;Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be&#10;wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way&#10;as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross.&#10;The cover can also be magically held shut using the *arcane lock* spell&#10;or similar magic.&#10;&#10;***Locking Pit***. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with&#10;one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded.&#10;After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its&#10;victim inside.&#10;&#10;A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open.&#10;The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also&#10;attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15&#10;Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be&#10;reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually&#10;hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.&#10;&#10;***Spiked Pit***. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap&#10;with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling&#10;into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in&#10;addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison&#10;smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from&#10;the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an&#10;22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a&#10;successful one.">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Poison Darts" _note="*Mechanical trap*&#10;&#10;When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts&#10;shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the&#10;surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each&#10;one rigged to its own set of darts.&#10;&#10;The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or&#10;cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the&#10;walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence&#10;(Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the&#10;pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create&#10;it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other&#10;object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.&#10;Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within&#10;from launching.&#10;&#10;The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the&#10;pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack&#10;with a +8&#10;&#10;bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate&#10;(vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in&#10;the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2&#10;(1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving&#10;throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much&#10;damage on a successful one.">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Poison Needle" _note="*Mechanical trap*&#10;&#10;A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in&#10;something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the&#10;proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.&#10;&#10;When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out&#10;from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11&#10;(2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving&#10;throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.&#10;&#10;A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character&#10;to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to&#10;accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using&#10;thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock.&#10;Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.">

      <outline text="Rolling Sphere" _note="*Mechanical trap*&#10;&#10;When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure&#10;plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot&#10;diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.&#10;&#10;With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot&#10;the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a&#10;successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations&#10;in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The&#10;same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the&#10;stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other&#10;object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.&#10;&#10;Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll&#10;initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it&#10;moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’&#10;spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as&#10;difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a&#10;creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed&#10;on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage&#10;and be knocked prone.&#10;&#10;The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go&#10;around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving&#10;turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.&#10;&#10;As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow&#10;it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s&#10;speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops&#10;moving and is no longer a threat.">

      <outline text="Sphere of Annihilation" _note="*Magic trap*&#10;&#10;Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face&#10;carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly&#10;circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of&#10;it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.&#10;&#10;A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth&#10;contains a *sphere of annihilation* that can’t be controlled or moved.&#10;It is otherwise identical to a normal *sphere of annihilation*.&#10;&#10;Some versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone&#10;face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to&#10;approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like&#10;the sympathy aspect of the *antipathy/sympathy* spell. A successful&#10;*dispel magic* (DC 18) removes this enchantment.">

  <outline text="Diseases" _note="A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find&#10;a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for&#10;centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A&#10;warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that&#10;spreads whenever he casts spells.&#10;&#10;A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on&#10;party resources, curable by a casting of *lesser restoration*. A more&#10;complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as&#10;characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal&#10;with the consequences.&#10;&#10;A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a&#10;plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how&#10;it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren’t bound&#10;by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given&#10;illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to&#10;another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep&#10;through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What&#10;matters is the story you want to tell.">

The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that&#10;can’t be removed until the disease is cured.&#10;&#10;Any event that causes the infected creature great stress-including&#10;entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a&#10;nightmare-forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.&#10;On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes&#10;incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat&#10;the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad&#10;laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.&#10;&#10;Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected&#10;creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10&#10;Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once&#10;a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of&#10;that particular infected creature for 24 hours.&#10;&#10;At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13&#10;Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save&#10;and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When&#10;the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease.&#10;A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly&#10;determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this&#10;chapter.">

At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the&#10;penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is blinded until&#10;its sight is restored by magic such as *lesser restoration* or *heal*.&#10;&#10;Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows&#10;in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an&#10;herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment.

Large objects also tend to have more hit&#10;points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is&#10;just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points&#10;table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects&#10;that are Large or smaller.&#10;&#10;**Table- Object’s Hit Points**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;***Huge and Gargantuan Objects***. Normal weapons are of little use&#10;against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue,&#10;towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can&#10;burn a Huge tapestry, and an *earthquake* spell can reduce a colossus to&#10;rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object’s hit points if you&#10;like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand&#10;whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points&#10;for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each&#10;section’s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could&#10;ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human&#10;might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.&#10;&#10;***Objects and Damage Types***. Objects are immune to poison and psychic&#10;damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective&#10;against a particular object or substance than others. For example,&#10;bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting&#10;through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to&#10;fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can’t&#10;effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.&#10;&#10;***Damage Threshold***. Big objects such as castle walls often have&#10;extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a&#10;damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of&#10;damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its&#10;damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage&#10;that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered&#10;superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hit points.">

  <outline text="Poisons" _note="Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most&#10;societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil&#10;creatures.&#10;&#10;Poisons come in the following four types.&#10;&#10;***Contact***. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains&#10;potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches&#10;contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.&#10;&#10;***Ingested***. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested&#10;poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a&#10;liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as&#10;allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a&#10;failed save.&#10;&#10;***Inhaled***. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when&#10;inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a&#10;5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately&#10;afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons,&#10;as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.&#10;&#10;***Injury***. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap&#10;components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and&#10;remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature&#10;that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the&#10;poison is exposed to its effects.&#10;&#10;**Table- List of Poisons**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">
    <outline text="Sample Poisons" _note="Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.&#10;&#10;***Assassin’s Blood (Ingested)***. A creature subjected to this poison&#10;must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes&#10;6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful&#10;save, the creature takes half damage and isn’t poisoned.&#10;&#10;***Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled)***. A creature subjected to this poison&#10;must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6)&#10;poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of&#10;its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6)&#10;poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends.&#10;&#10;***Crawler Mucus (Contact)***. This poison must be harvested from a dead&#10;or incapacitated crawler. A creature subjected to this poison must&#10;succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1&#10;minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the&#10;saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on&#10;itself on a success.&#10;&#10;***Drow Poison (Injury)***. This poison is typically made only by the&#10;drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature&#10;subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving&#10;throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more,&#10;the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The&#10;creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an&#10;action to shake it awake.&#10;&#10;***Essence of Ether (Inhaled)***. A creature subjected to this poison&#10;must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for&#10;8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if&#10;it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it&#10;awake.&#10;&#10;***Malice (Inhaled)***. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed&#10;on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The&#10;poisoned creature is blinded.&#10;&#10;***Midnight Tears (Ingested)***. A creature that ingests this poison&#10;suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not&#10;been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17&#10;Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed&#10;save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&#10;&#10;***Oil of Taggit (Contact)***. A creature subjected to this poison must&#10;succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24&#10;hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it&#10;takes damage.&#10;&#10;***Pale Tincture (Ingested)***. A creature subjected to this poison must&#10;succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison&#10;damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving&#10;throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save.&#10;Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can’t be healed by&#10;any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the&#10;creature can heal normally.&#10;&#10;***Purple Worm Poison (Injury)***. This poison must be harvested from a&#10;dead or incapacitated purple worm. A creature subjected to this poison&#10;must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison&#10;damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&#10;&#10;***Serpent Venom (Injury)***. This poison must be harvested from a dead&#10;or incapacitated giant poisonous snake. A creature subjected to this&#10;poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10&#10;(3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a&#10;successful one.&#10;&#10;***Torpor (Ingested)***.

The poisoned creature can’t knowingly speak a lie, as if under the&#10;effect of a *zone of truth* spell.&#10;&#10;***Wyvern Poison (Injury)***. This poison must be harvested from a dead&#10;or incapacitated wyvern. A creature subjected to this poison must make a&#10;DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a&#10;failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.">

  <outline text="Apparatus of the Crab" _note="*Wondrous item, legendary*&#10;&#10;This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500&#10;pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a&#10;successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch&#10;unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller&#10;creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end,&#10;each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain&#10;levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.&#10;&#10;The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following&#10;statistics:&#10;&#10;**Armor Class** 20&#10;&#10;**Hit Points** 200&#10;&#10;**Speed** 30 ft., swim 30 ft.

It can also go underwater to a depth of&#10;900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per&#10;minute from pressure.&#10;&#10;A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two&#10;of the apparatus’s levers up or down.

Each creature in the area,&#10;including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire&#10;damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The&#10;fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or&#10;carried.&#10;&#10;If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then&#10;water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground&#10;where it was planted.

  <outline text="Bag of Devouring" _note="*Wondrous item, very rare*&#10;&#10;This bag superficially resembles a *bag of holding* but is a feeding&#10;orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside&#10;out closes the orifice.&#10;&#10;The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is&#10;placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the&#10;bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is&#10;placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a&#10;50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature&#10;inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC&#10;15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the&#10;bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength&#10;check (provided it isn’t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that&#10;starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.&#10;&#10;Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot&#10;of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects&#10;inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM&#10;determines the time and plane.&#10;&#10;If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained&#10;within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.">

  <outline text="Bag of Holding" _note="*Wondrous item, uncommon*&#10;&#10;This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside&#10;dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The&#10;bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.&#10;The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item&#10;from the bag requires an action.&#10;&#10;If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is&#10;destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the&#10;bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the&#10;bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures&#10;inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided&#10;by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they&#10;begin to suffocate.&#10;&#10;Placing a *bag of holding* inside an extradimensional space created by a&#10;*handy haversack*, *portable hole*, or similar item instantly destroys&#10;both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates&#10;where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10&#10;feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral&#10;Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be&#10;reopened.">

  <outline text="Bag of Tricks" _note="*Wondrous item, uncommon*&#10;&#10;This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty.&#10;Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy&#10;object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.&#10;&#10;You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it&#10;up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you&#10;determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to&#10;the bag’s color.&#10;&#10;The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your&#10;turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and&#10;what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders,&#10;such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the&#10;creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.&#10;&#10;Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be&#10;used again until the next dawn.&#10;&#10;**Table- Gray Bag of Tricks**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;**Table- Rust Bag of Tricks**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;**Table- Tan Bag of Tricks**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

Typically, 1d4+4 *beads of force* are found together.&#10;&#10;You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes&#10;on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of&#10;where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or&#10;take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the&#10;area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely&#10;within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded&#10;on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the&#10;center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable&#10;air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.&#10;&#10;An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s&#10;wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s walking speed. The&#10;sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound,&#10;regardless of the weight of creatures inside.">

  <outline text="Broom of Flying" _note="*Wondrous item, uncommon*&#10;&#10;This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane broom&#10;until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then hovers&#10;beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50&#10;feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30&#10;feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you&#10;land.&#10;&#10;You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of&#10;you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar&#10;with that place.

  <outline text="Candle of Invocation" _note="*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*&#10;&#10;This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity’s&#10;alignment. The candle’s alignment can be detected with the *detect evil&#10;and good* spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or&#10;determines the alignment randomly.&#10;&#10;**Table- Candle of Invocation**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;The candle’s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires&#10;an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can&#10;snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in&#10;increments of 1 minute from the candle’s total burn time.&#10;&#10;While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature&#10;within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes&#10;attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In&#10;addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the&#10;candle’s can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without&#10;expending spell slots, though the spell’s effect is as if cast with a&#10;1st-level slot.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can&#10;cast the *gate* spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.">

You don’t need to concentrate on this *detect thoughts*&#10;to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends.&#10;&#10;***Crystal Ball of Telepathy***. While scrying with the crystal ball,&#10;you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30&#10;feet of the spell’s sensor. You can also use an action to cast the&#10;*suggestion* spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those&#10;creatures. You don’t need to concentrate on this *suggestion* to&#10;maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends.

Each face has a different effect. If the cube has&#10;insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of&#10;invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a&#10;side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1&#10;minute, until you use an action to press the cube’s sixth face, or the&#10;cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier’s effect by&#10;pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number&#10;of charges, resetting the duration.&#10;&#10;If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid&#10;object that can’t pass through the cube, you can’t move any closer to&#10;that object as long as the barrier remains.&#10;&#10;**Table- Cube of Force Effects**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or&#10;comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in&#10;the table below.&#10;&#10;**Table- Cube of Force Charges Lost**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies&#10;up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of&#10;it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage&#10;rolls.&#10;&#10;While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up&#10;to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same&#10;bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5&#10;feet of it.&#10;&#10;After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30&#10;feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it&#10;falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path&#10;to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground.&#10;It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away&#10;from it.">

The water stops pouring out at the start&#10;of your next turn. Choose from the following options:&#10;&#10;-   “Stream” produces 1 gallon of water.&#10;-   “Fountain” produces 5 gallons of water.&#10;-   “Geyser” produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser&#10;    30 feet long and 1 foot wide.

The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving&#10;    throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a&#10;    creature, you can target an object that isn’t being worn or carried&#10;    and that weighs no more than 200 pounds.

  <outline text="Deck of Illusions" _note="*Wondrous item, uncommon*&#10;&#10;This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A&#10;deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20-1 cards.&#10;&#10;The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you&#10;can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can&#10;use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the&#10;ground at a point within 30 feet of you.&#10;&#10;An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and&#10;remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the&#10;appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that&#10;it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory&#10;creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically&#10;anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the&#10;illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass&#10;through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature&#10;identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence&#10;(Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.&#10;&#10;The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.&#10;When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card&#10;can’t be used again.&#10;&#10;**Table- Deck of Illusions**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

Most (75 percent) of these decks have only&#10;thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.&#10;&#10;Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to&#10;draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing&#10;cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number&#10;have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its&#10;magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after&#10;the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining&#10;number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at&#10;once.&#10;&#10;Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the&#10;Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible&#10;to draw the same card twice.&#10;&#10;**Table- Deck of Many Things**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;\* Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards&#10;&#10;***Balance***.

Everything you were wearing and&#10;carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared.&#10;You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere.&#10;You can’t be located by any divination magic, but a *wish* spell can&#10;reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.&#10;&#10;***Euryale***. The card’s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2&#10;penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the&#10;magic of The Fates card can end this curse.&#10;&#10;***The Fates***. Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you&#10;to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the&#10;card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before&#10;you die.&#10;&#10;***Flames***. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your&#10;ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to&#10;slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.&#10;&#10;***Fool***. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the&#10;deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing&#10;that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount&#10;that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.&#10;&#10;***Gem***.

You are granted the ability to cast the *wish* spell 1d3&#10;times.&#10;&#10;***Rogue***. A nonplayer character of the GM’s choice becomes hostile&#10;toward you.

Nothing less than a *wish* spell or divine&#10;intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.&#10;&#10;***Ruin***. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic&#10;items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes.

Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to&#10;this card also disappears.&#10;&#10;***Skull***. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton&#10;clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears&#10;in a space of the GM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you,&#10;warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights&#10;until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If&#10;anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death.

At any time you choose within one year of drawing this&#10;card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a&#10;truthful answer to that question.

This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from&#10;your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice. One&#10;or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in&#10;this way, your body is incapacitated.

The duration is the same for all subjects,&#10;and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect.

The dust turns a cube of water 15&#10;feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near&#10;where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.&#10;&#10;Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface,&#10;causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed.&#10;Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.&#10;&#10;An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the&#10;dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic&#10;damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.">

Closing the bottle&#10;requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is&#10;closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes.

The GM chooses the kind&#10;of token or determines it randomly.&#10;&#10;**Table- Feather Token**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;***Anchor***. You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or&#10;ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means.&#10;Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect&#10;ends, the token disappears.&#10;&#10;***Bird***. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air.&#10;The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place.&#10;The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands&#10;and can’t attack.

The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a&#10;day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an&#10;action.&#10;&#10;***Fan***. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss&#10;the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant&#10;flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong&#10;enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles&#10;per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.&#10;&#10;***Swan Boat***. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of&#10;water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot&#10;long, 20-foot wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is&#10;self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour.&#10;You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn&#10;up to 90 degrees.

You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack&#10;against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of&#10;+9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6+5 force damage.&#10;&#10;As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20&#10;feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it.

  <outline text="Figurine of Wondrous Power" _note="*Wondrous item, rarity by figurine*&#10;&#10;A *figurine of wondrous power* is a statuette of a beast small enough to&#10;fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and&#10;throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the&#10;figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature&#10;would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there&#10;isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a&#10;creature.&#10;&#10;The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your&#10;languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the&#10;creature defends itself but takes no other actions.&#10;&#10;The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end&#10;of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts&#10;to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action&#10;to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature&#10;becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a&#10;certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s&#10;description.&#10;&#10;***Bronze Griffon (Rare)***.

Each goat looks unique and functions&#10;differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:&#10;&#10;-   The *goat of traveling* can become a Large goat with the same&#10;    statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or&#10;    portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has&#10;    charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of&#10;    charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7&#10;    days have passed, when it regains all its charges.&#10;-   The *goat of travail* becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once&#10;    it has been used, it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.&#10;-   The *goat of terror* becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The&#10;    goat can’t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as&#10;    weapons. One horn becomes a *+1 lance*, and the other becomes a *+2&#10;    longsword*. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons&#10;    disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine&#10;    form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot radius aura of terror&#10;    while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its&#10;    turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be&#10;    frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to&#10;    figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw&#10;    at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a&#10;    success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature&#10;    is immune to the goat’s aura for the next 24 hours. Once the&#10;    figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days have&#10;    passed.&#10;&#10;***Marble Elephant (Rare)***. This marble statuette is about 4 inches&#10;high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has&#10;been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.&#10;&#10;***Obsidian Steed (Very Rare)***. This polished obsidian horse can&#10;become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to&#10;defend itself. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5&#10;days have passed.&#10;&#10;If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each&#10;time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to&#10;figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your&#10;orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random&#10;location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine&#10;form.&#10;&#10;***Onyx Dog (Rare)***. This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff&#10;for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak&#10;Common.

Once it has been&#10;used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.&#10;&#10;***Serpentine Owl (Rare)***. This serpentine statuette of an owl can&#10;become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be&#10;used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically&#10;communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of&#10;existence.&#10;&#10;***Silver Raven (Uncommon)***. This silver statuette of a raven can&#10;become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be&#10;used again until 2 days have passed.

This item also has three command words,&#10;each requiring you to use an action to speak it.&#10;&#10;One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4&#10;feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a&#10;mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures&#10;comfortably.&#10;&#10;The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet&#10;long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats,&#10;five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast&#10;with a square sail.

This effect&#10;    doesn’t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to&#10;    repeat the command word or until you use another function of the&#10;    gem.&#10;-   The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire&#10;    a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet&#10;    of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving&#10;    throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the&#10;    saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on&#10;    itself on a success.&#10;-   The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare&#10;    with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each&#10;    creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the&#10;    beam created with the second command word.&#10;&#10;When all of the gem’s charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical&#10;jewel worth 50 gp.">

If a breathing creature is&#10;placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10&#10;minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.&#10;&#10;Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a *bag&#10;of holding*, *portable hole*, or similar item instantly destroys both&#10;items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where&#10;the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of&#10;the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the&#10;Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t&#10;be reopened.">

Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust.&#10;When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.&#10;&#10;You gain the following benefits while wearing it:&#10;&#10;-   You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC&#10;    18), using one of the helm’s gems of the specified type as a&#10;    component: *daylight* (opal), *fireball* (fire opal), *prismatic&#10;    spray* (diamond), or *wall of fire* (ruby). The gem is destroyed&#10;    when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.&#10;-   As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in&#10;    a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any&#10;    undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.&#10;-   As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to&#10;    fire damage.&#10;-   As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an&#10;    action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding&#10;    to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot&#10;    radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are&#10;    harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using&#10;    the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The&#10;    flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word&#10;    again or until you drop or stow the weapon.&#10;&#10;Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result&#10;of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm&#10;emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60&#10;feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving&#10;throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number&#10;of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.">

  <outline text="Instant Fortress" _note="*Wondrous item, rare*&#10;&#10;You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and&#10;speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that&#10;remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses&#10;it, which works only if the fortress is empty.&#10;&#10;The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with&#10;arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is&#10;divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect&#10;them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated,&#10;the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only&#10;at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to&#10;the *knock* spell and similar magic, such as that of a *chime of&#10;opening*.&#10;&#10;Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15&#10;Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed&#10;save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the&#10;creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the&#10;fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take&#10;this damage and are pushed automatically.&#10;&#10;The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being&#10;tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points,&#10;&#10;immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and&#10;resistance to all other damage. Only a *wish* spell can repair the&#10;fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th&#10;level or lower). Each casting of *wish* causes the roof, the door, or&#10;one wall to regain 50 hit points.">

Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net&#10;the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack&#10;roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.&#10;You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.&#10;&#10;A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is&#10;considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.&#10;&#10;***Absorption (Very Rare)***. While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits&#10;your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or&#10;lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.&#10;&#10;Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns&#10;dull gray, losing its magic.

When found, it contains 1d4-1 levels of&#10;stored spells chosen by the GM.&#10;&#10;Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by&#10;touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to&#10;be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is&#10;expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell&#10;determines how much space it uses.&#10;&#10;While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it.&#10;The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and&#10;spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as&#10;if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored&#10;in it, freeing up space.&#10;&#10;***Strength (Very Rare)***.

On a hit, the target is restrained&#10;until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release&#10;it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract&#10;and become a sphere once more.&#10;&#10;A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC&#10;20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is&#10;destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed.

If the target has been trapped by the&#10;flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a&#10;creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only&#10;one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to&#10;breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.&#10;&#10;You can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the&#10;creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your&#10;companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you&#10;give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its&#10;death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of&#10;the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal&#10;disposition and alignment.&#10;&#10;An *identify* spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the&#10;only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask.

The paint&#10;flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on&#10;its image.&#10;&#10;Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface,&#10;which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a&#10;door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons - that are up to&#10;10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.&#10;&#10;When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted&#10;becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall&#10;creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond.&#10;Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts&#10;against the total area of objects you create.&#10;&#10;Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If&#10;you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of&#10;gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is&#10;made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.&#10;&#10;If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy&#10;appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no&#10;harm to anything.">

It shatters&#10;and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.&#10;&#10;If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet&#10;of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it.&#10;It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word&#10;again.&#10;&#10;Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated&#10;mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma&#10;saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or&#10;carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This&#10;saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s&#10;nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.&#10;&#10;An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog&#10;that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s&#10;cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature&#10;trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel.&#10;Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.&#10;&#10;If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are&#10;already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to&#10;accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied&#10;space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror&#10;is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in&#10;unoccupied spaces near it.&#10;&#10;While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the&#10;name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by&#10;number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an&#10;image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate&#10;normally.&#10;&#10;In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word&#10;and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears,&#10;along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the&#10;mirror and facing away from it.">

If a magic&#10;bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.&#10;&#10;Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on&#10;the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than&#10;one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace.&#10;Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action&#10;(using your spell save DC if a save is necessary).

While&#10;you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are&#10;indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or&#10;harm them.&#10;&#10;The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can&#10;use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of&#10;rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within&#10;half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the&#10;GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted.&#10;Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but&#10;aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended&#10;charges daily at dawn.&#10;&#10;Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control&#10;comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can&#10;make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose&#10;the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed&#10;by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the&#10;swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your&#10;companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as&#10;an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no&#10;commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no&#10;actions.

The cylindrical space within the&#10;hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open&#10;passages. Any creature inside an open *portable hole* can exit the hole&#10;by climbing out of it.&#10;&#10;You can use an action to close a *portable hole* by taking hold of the&#10;edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole,&#10;and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional&#10;space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.&#10;&#10;If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional&#10;space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful&#10;check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the&#10;*portable hole* or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within&#10;a closed *portable hole* can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which&#10;time it begins to suffocate.&#10;&#10;Placing a *portable hole* inside an extradimensional space created by a&#10;*bag of holding*, *handy haversack*, or similar item instantly destroys&#10;both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates&#10;where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10&#10;feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location&#10;on the Astral Plane.

  <outline text="Rod of Absorption" _note="*Rod, very rare (requires attunement)*&#10;&#10;While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that&#10;is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed&#10;spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy-not the spell&#10;itself-is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell&#10;when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy&#10;over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of&#10;energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the&#10;rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.&#10;&#10;When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy&#10;the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many&#10;levels of spell energy it currently has stored.&#10;&#10;If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored&#10;in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can&#10;create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell&#10;slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place&#10;of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal.

While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one&#10;of the following spells from it: *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*,&#10;*detect poison and disease*, or *see invisibility.*&#10;&#10;***Protective Aura***. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the&#10;rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds bright light in a&#10;60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet.

The rod has&#10;properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row&#10;along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.&#10;&#10;***Six Buttons***. You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus&#10;action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or&#10;until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to&#10;its normal form.&#10;&#10;If you press **button 1**, the rod becomes a *flame tongue*, as a fiery&#10;blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head (you choose&#10;the type of sword).&#10;&#10;If you press **button 2**, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two&#10;crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic&#10;battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with&#10;it.&#10;&#10;If you press **button 3**, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear&#10;point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a&#10;6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3&#10;bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.&#10;&#10;If you press **button 4**, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to&#10;50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at&#10;the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3&#10;inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The&#10;pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring&#10;causes the rod to revert to its normal form.&#10;&#10;If you press **button 5**, the rod transforms into a handheld battering&#10;ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break&#10;through doors, barricades, and other barriers.&#10;&#10;If you press **button 6**, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form&#10;and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the&#10;rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.)

  <outline text="Sphere of Annihilation" _note="*Wondrous item, legendary*&#10;&#10;This 2-foot diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering&#10;in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.&#10;&#10;The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that&#10;passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is&#10;susceptible to damage from a *sphere of annihilation*, it passes through&#10;the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t&#10;wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.&#10;&#10;The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60&#10;feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25&#10;Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one&#10;direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your&#10;Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves&#10;10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must&#10;succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking&#10;4d10 force damage.&#10;&#10;If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature’s&#10;control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other&#10;creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains&#10;control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.&#10;&#10;If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that&#10;created by the *gate* spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that&#10;within a *portable hole*, the GM determines randomly what happens, using&#10;the following table.&#10;&#10;**Table- Sphere of Annihilation**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving&#10;throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened&#10;in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away&#10;from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30&#10;feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use&#10;only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it&#10;from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the&#10;Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the&#10;saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.">

<outline text="Artifacts">
  <outline text="Orb of Dragonkind" _note="*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*&#10;&#10;Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons.&#10;When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked&#10;their greatest magic, forging five *Orbs of Dragonkind* (or *Dragon&#10;Orbs*) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the&#10;five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a&#10;victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then&#10;destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.&#10;&#10;As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or&#10;faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic&#10;has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their&#10;primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some&#10;measure of control over dragons.&#10;&#10;Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents&#10;any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality&#10;might find themselves enslaved to an orb.&#10;&#10;An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When&#10;used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside&#10;it.&#10;&#10;While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s&#10;depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma&#10;check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you&#10;remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb&#10;for as long as you remain attuned to it.&#10;&#10;While you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your&#10;attunement to it, and the orb casts *suggestion* on you at will (save DC&#10;18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon&#10;essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a&#10;particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the&#10;world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM&#10;decides.&#10;&#10;***Random Properties***. An *Orb of Dragonkind* has the following random&#10;properties:&#10;&#10;-   2 minor beneficial properties&#10;-   1 minor detrimental property&#10;-   1 major detrimental property&#10;&#10;***Spells***. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4+3 expended charges&#10;daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend&#10;1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from&#10;it: *cure wounds* (5th-level version, 3 charges), *daylight* (1 charge),&#10;*death ward* (2 charges), or *scrying* (3 charges).&#10;&#10;You can also use an action to cast the *detect magic* spell from the orb&#10;without using any charges.&#10;&#10;***Call Dragons***. While you control the orb, you can use an action to&#10;cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all&#10;directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to&#10;the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities&#10;such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb&#10;might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once&#10;you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.&#10;&#10;***Destroying an Orb***. An *Orb of Dragonkind* appears fragile but is&#10;impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of&#10;dragons. A *disintegrate* spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon&#10;is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.">

<outline text="Monsters">
</outline>
<outline text="Monster Statistics">
  <outline text="Type" _note="A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic&#10;items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special&#10;ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an *arrow of&#10;dragon slaying* deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other&#10;creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.&#10;&#10;The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of&#10;their own.&#10;&#10;**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate&#10;magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the&#10;mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are&#10;aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.&#10;&#10;**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the&#10;fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are&#10;unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all&#10;varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.&#10;&#10;**Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them&#10;are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the&#10;mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature,&#10;so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a&#10;horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.&#10;&#10;**Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators&#10;to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with&#10;sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic&#10;constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such&#10;as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by&#10;the will of more powerful creatures.&#10;&#10;**Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and&#10;tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and&#10;the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate&#10;magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true&#10;dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as&#10;wyverns and pseudodragons.&#10;&#10;**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some&#10;creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their&#10;respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals.&#10;Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of&#10;genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important&#10;civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include&#10;azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.&#10;&#10;**Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They&#10;dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are&#10;closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are&#10;also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and&#10;the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.&#10;&#10;**Fiends** are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower&#10;Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the&#10;leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages&#10;sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an&#10;evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends&#10;include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.&#10;&#10;**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in&#10;shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities&#10;(fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone&#10;giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants.&#10;Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.&#10;&#10;**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both&#10;civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other&#10;species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical&#10;abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal&#10;form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as&#10;player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as&#10;numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are&#10;the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs,&#10;gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.&#10;&#10;**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sense-frightening&#10;creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never&#10;benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such&#10;as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including&#10;minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense&#10;serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any&#10;other type.&#10;&#10;**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They&#10;are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on&#10;refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black&#10;puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.&#10;&#10;**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora.&#10;Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The&#10;quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal&#10;creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this&#10;category.&#10;&#10;**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of&#10;undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse.&#10;Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as&#10;bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.">
    <outline text="Tags" _note="A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in&#10;parentheses. For example, an orc has the *humanoid (orc)* type. The&#10;parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain&#10;creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the&#10;game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear&#10;that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any&#10;monster that has the demon tag.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Alignment" _note="A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it&#10;behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic&#10;evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack&#10;characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to&#10;negotiate. See the *Player’s Handbook* for descriptions of the different&#10;alignments.&#10;&#10;The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel&#10;free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the&#10;needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an&#10;evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.&#10;&#10;Some creatures can have **any alignment**. In other words, you choose&#10;the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a&#10;tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a&#10;berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral,&#10;or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.&#10;&#10;Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or&#10;chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but&#10;rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means&#10;they don’t have an alignment.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Armor Class" _note="A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC)&#10;that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a&#10;monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if&#10;any.

  <outline text="Hit Points" _note="A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.&#10;For more on hit points, see the *Player’s Handbook*.&#10;&#10;A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an&#10;average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit&#10;points on average (2 × 4½).&#10;&#10;A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as&#10;shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.&#10;&#10;**Table- Hit Dice by Size**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]&#10;&#10;A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points&#10;it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit&#10;Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For&#10;example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit&#10;Dice, it has 2d8+2 hit points (average 11).">

  <outline text="Speed" _note="A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more&#10;information on speed, see the *Player’s Handbook*.&#10;&#10;All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed.&#10;Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking&#10;speed of 0 feet.&#10;&#10;Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement&#10;modes.">
    <outline text="Burrow" _note="A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through&#10;sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock&#10;unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.">

    <outline text="Fly" _note="A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to&#10;fly. Some monsters have the ability to **hover**, which makes them hard&#10;to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the&#10;*Player’s Handbook*). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.">

  <outline text="Saving Throws" _note="The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at&#10;resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t&#10;easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving&#10;throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which&#10;case this section is absent.&#10;&#10;A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier&#10;and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s&#10;challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating&#10;table).&#10;&#10;**Table- Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

  <outline text="Skills" _note="The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or&#10;more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy&#10;might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth)&#10;checks.&#10;&#10;A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and&#10;its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge&#10;rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).&#10;Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a&#10;larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to&#10;account for its heightened expertise.&#10;&#10;***Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies***&#10;&#10;*Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and&#10;tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is&#10;proficient with its new equipment.*&#10;&#10;*For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a&#10;greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe&#10;instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other,&#10;or neither.*&#10;&#10;*See the Player’s Handbook for rules on using armor or weapons without&#10;proficiency.*">

    <outline text="Blindsight" _note="A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying&#10;on sight, within a specific radius.&#10;&#10;Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have&#10;this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened&#10;senses, such as bats and true dragons.&#10;&#10;If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this&#10;effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum&#10;range of its perception.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Darkvision" _note="A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius.&#10;The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright&#10;light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can’t&#10;discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live&#10;underground have this special sense.">

    <outline text="Tremorsense" _note="A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of&#10;vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the&#10;source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or&#10;substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal&#10;creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks,&#10;have this special sense.">

    <outline text="Truesight" _note="A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and&#10;magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically&#10;detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and&#10;perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is&#10;transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal&#10;Plane within the same range.">

  <outline text="Languages" _note="The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order.&#10;Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it, and&#10;this is noted in its entry. A “-” indicates that a creature neither&#10;speaks nor understands any language.">
    <outline text="Telepathy" _note="Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate&#10;mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted&#10;creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to&#10;communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at&#10;least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond&#10;to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic&#10;conversation.&#10;&#10;A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can&#10;end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as&#10;the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the&#10;telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A&#10;telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation&#10;without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it&#10;can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is&#10;terminated.&#10;&#10;A creature within the area of an *antimagic field* or in any other&#10;location where magic doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic&#10;messages.">
    </outline>
  </outline>
  <outline text="Challenge" _note="A monster’s **Challenge rating** tells you how great a threat the&#10;monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four&#10;adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge&#10;rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a&#10;party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a&#10;challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.&#10;&#10;Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a&#10;challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are&#10;insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks&#10;are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth&#10;10 XP each.&#10;&#10;Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level&#10;party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher&#10;and are specifically designed to test player skill.">
    <outline text="Experience Points" _note="The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its&#10;challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster,&#10;although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by&#10;the monster in some other manner.&#10;&#10;Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or&#10;other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.&#10;&#10;**Table- Experience Points by Challenge Rating**&#10;&#10;[TABLE]">

  <outline text="Special Traits" _note="Special traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating but&#10;before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to&#10;be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.">
    <outline text="Innate Spellcasting" _note="A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate&#10;Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of&#10;1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and&#10;can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its&#10;level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.&#10;&#10;An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a&#10;drow mage can innately cast the *levitate* spell, but the spell has a&#10;“self only” restriction, which means that the spell affects only the&#10;drow mage.&#10;&#10;A monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells. If a&#10;monster’s innate spells don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is&#10;given for them.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Spellcasting" _note="A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level&#10;and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and&#10;higher (as explained in the *Player’s Handbook*). The spellcaster level&#10;is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.&#10;&#10;The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific&#10;class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class,&#10;such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle&#10;feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class&#10;when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the&#10;class or access to its spell list.&#10;&#10;A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the&#10;spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level&#10;*lightning bolt* spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of&#10;its 5th-level greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge&#10;rating.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Psionics" _note="A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the&#10;psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special&#10;trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of&#10;the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically&#10;doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.">

  <outline text="Actions" _note="When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the&#10;Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to&#10;all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the&#10;*Player’s Handbook*.">
    <outline text="Melee and Ranged Attacks" _note="The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and&#10;ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the&#10;“weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a&#10;claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks,&#10;see the *Player’s Handbook*.&#10;&#10;***Creature vs Target***. The target of a melee or ranged attack is&#10;usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a&#10;“target” can be a creature or an object.&#10;&#10;***Hit***. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of&#10;an attack hitting a target are described after the “Hit” notation. You&#10;have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this&#10;reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.&#10;&#10;***Miss***. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that&#10;information is presented after the “Miss:” notation.&#10;&#10;***Grapple Rules for Monsters***&#10;&#10;*Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple&#10;prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make&#10;an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds,&#10;unless the attack says otherwise.*&#10;&#10;*A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape.&#10;To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity&#10;(Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster’s stat block. If&#10;no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10+the monster’s Strength&#10;(Athletics) modifier.*">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Multiattack" _note="A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the&#10;Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an&#10;opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.">
    </outline>
    <outline text="Ammunition" _note="A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can&#10;assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon&#10;attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a&#10;bow or crossbow.">

  </outline>
  <outline text="Reactions" _note="If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that&#10;information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction,&#10;this section is absent.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Limited Usage" _note="Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can&#10;be used.&#10;&#10;***X/Day***. The notation “X/Day” means a special ability can be used X&#10;number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain&#10;expended uses. For example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used&#10;once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.&#10;&#10;***Recharge X-Y***. The notation “Recharge X-Y” means a monster can use&#10;a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of&#10;recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each&#10;of the monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in&#10;the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special&#10;ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or&#10;long rest.&#10;&#10;For example, “Recharge 5-6” means a monster can use the special ability&#10;once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of&#10;that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.&#10;&#10;***Recharge after a Short or Long Rest***. This notation means that a&#10;monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or&#10;long rest to use it again.">
  </outline>
  <outline text="Equipment" _note="A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons&#10;used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a&#10;humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.&#10;&#10;You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you&#10;like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable&#10;after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still&#10;usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by&#10;someone else, for instance.&#10;&#10;If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells,&#10;assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells&#10;in its stat block.">

<outline text="Legendary Creatures" _note="A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can&#10;take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical&#10;influence for miles around.&#10;&#10;If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through&#10;a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or&#10;regional effects.">
  <outline text="Legendary Actions" _note="A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions-called&#10;legendary actions-outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can&#10;be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A&#10;creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.&#10;It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or&#10;otherwise unable to take actions.

When commanded to do so by&#10;the wearer or when a situation arises that was predefined by the&#10;spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored spell with any parameters set&#10;by the original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast&#10;or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.">

If the vampire isn’t in sunlight or running water,&#10;it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of&#10;mist, or back into its true form.&#10;&#10;While in bat form, the vampire can’t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet,&#10;and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its&#10;size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with&#10;it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it&#10;dies.&#10;&#10;While in mist form, the vampire can’t take any actions, speak, or&#10;manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can&#10;hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In&#10;addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without&#10;squeezing, and it can’t pass through water. It has advantage on&#10;Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to&#10;all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.&#10;&#10;***Legendary Resistance (3/Day)***. If the vampire fails a saving throw,&#10;it can choose to succeed instead.&#10;&#10;***Misty Escape***. When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting&#10;place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the&#10;Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it&#10;isn’t in sunlight or running water. If it can’t transform, it is&#10;destroyed.&#10;&#10;While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its vampire&#10;form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be&#10;destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It&#10;is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending&#10;1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.&#10;&#10;***Regeneration***. The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of&#10;its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running&#10;water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water,&#10;this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vampire’s next turn.&#10;&#10;***Spider Climb***. The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including&#10;upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.&#10;&#10;***Vampire Weaknesses***. The vampire has the following flaws:&#10;&#10;*Forbiddance*. The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation&#10;from one of the occupants.&#10;&#10;*Harmed by Running Water*. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends&#10;its turn in running water.&#10;&#10;*Stake to the Heart*. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into&#10;the vampire’s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting&#10;place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.&#10;&#10;*Sunlight Hypersensitivity*. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it&#10;starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on&#10;attack rolls and ability checks.">
      <outline text="Actions" _note="***Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)***. The vampire makes two attacks,&#10;only one of which can be a bite attack.&#10;&#10;***Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to&#10;hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (1d8+4) bludgeoning damage.&#10;Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC&#10;18).&#10;&#10;***Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit,&#10;reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the&#10;vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. *Hit:* 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage&#10;plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced&#10;by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains&#10;hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target&#10;finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit&#10;point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the&#10;ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire’s&#10;control.&#10;&#10;***Charm***. The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet&#10;of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a&#10;DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the&#10;vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to&#10;be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the vampire’s&#10;control, it takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most&#10;favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire’s bite&#10;attack.&#10;&#10;Each time the vampire or the vampire’s companions do anything harmful to&#10;the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself&#10;on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire&#10;is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or&#10;takes a bonus action to end the effect.&#10;&#10;***Children of the Night (1/Day)***. The vampire magically calls 2d4&#10;swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn’t up. While outdoors,&#10;the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in&#10;1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken&#10;commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until&#10;the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.">

The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time.&#10;&#10;If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and&#10;can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.">

You can substitute any spell on the NPC’s&#10;spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell&#10;list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s challenge&#10;rating.&#10;&#10;***Armor and Weapon Swaps***. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s&#10;armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage&#10;can change an NPC’s challenge rating.&#10;&#10;***Magic Items***. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one&#10;or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might&#10;have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls.&#10;Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its&#10;challenge rating.">
