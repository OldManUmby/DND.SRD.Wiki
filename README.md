**The Systems Reference Document (SRD)** contains guidelines for publishing content under the Open-Gaming License (OGL). The [Dungeon Masters Guild](http://dungeonmastersguild.com/) also provides self-publishing opportunities for individuals and groups. The OGL and Dungeon Masters Guild offer different kinds of publishing opportunities. For an overview of the programs, please visit the official [Wizards SRD page](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd).

**Why Markdown format?** Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net). It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

**The "Pages" Contained Herein** were exported directly from the official SRD PDF (see below), but have been fully re-edited into Markdown for improved organization, portability and conversions to other formats. This is not a basic conversion as you find elsewhere, we have painstakingly remastered the original Wizard's SRD PDF to markdown format paragraph-by-paragraph. Please report any issues you find through this GitHub account. Thank you!
