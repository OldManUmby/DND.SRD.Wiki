## Half-Dragon Template

A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon. It keeps its statistics, except as follows.

***Challenge***. To avoid recalculating the creature's challenge rating, apply the template only to a creature that meets the optional prerequisite in the Breath Weapon table below. Otherwise, recalculate the rating after you apply the template.

**Senses**. The half-dragon gains blindsight with a radius of 10 feet and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.

***Resistances***. The half-dragon gains resistance to a type of damage based on its color.
